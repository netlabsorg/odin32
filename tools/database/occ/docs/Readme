This is a distribution package of OpenC++ version 2.5.


** Compilation

To compile the OpenC++ compiler, move to src/{Unix,Win32} and run make
with the makefile for your target, for example:

  % make -f Makefile.Linux

We made sure that the OpenC++ compiler can be compiled with gcc on
Solaris, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and SunOS (some sample programs do
not run on SunOS.)

Since the OpenC++ compiler uses Boehm's conservative garbage collector
(Note: the object code produced by OpenC++ does not use it,) the
library gc.a needs to be installed on your target in advance.  For
your convenience, this package includes the 4.14 distribution of that
garbage collector and you should move to src/gc/ and run "make c++"
(Don't forget "c++"!) there before running make under src/{Unix,Win32}.
For more details, see src/gc/README.


** Tips

- If you have a trouble to run the OpenC++ compiler, first make sure of
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  It has to include the current directory.

- Some g++ installations uses GNU ld, but this configuration may break
  dlopen().  ld supplied by the operating system should be used.

- If the operating system is Solaris 2.x, you may need -DSOLARIS_THREADS 
  to build the garbage collector.  If this option is specified, you also
  need to edit src/Unix/Makefile.Solaris so that CXXFLAGS includes
  that option and LIB includes -lthread.

- If your operating system is Solaris 2.6, you should insert:

	typedef unsigned long uint32_t;

  before the line:

	#include <sys/procfs.h>

  in src/gc/os_dep.c.

- If the platform is Win32, Visual C++'s BIN directory has to be
  in the search path.

- If you have a trouble of the garbage collector, try the latest version
  available from http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc.
  Otherwise, the following step-by-step instruction may help you build
  gc.a.

  Step1: cd src/gc
  Step2: Change os_dep.c and Makefile if necessary
  Step3: make test
	 You should see SUCCEEDED.
  Step4: make clean c++
	 You should see "The test appears to have succeeded."
  Step5: cd ../{Unix,Win32}
  Step6: make
  Step7: cd ../gc; make clean
	 You don't need gc.a any more.

  Note: if your platform is Irix, you have to specify ABI_FLAG (= n32).
