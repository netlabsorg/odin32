<P>
OpenC++ is a toolkit for C++ translators and analyzers.  It was
designed to enable the users to develop those tools without concerning
tedious parts of the development such as the parser and the type
system.  There are a number of tools that OpenC++ facilitates the
development of.  For example, the users can easily develop a C++
translator for implementing a language extension to C++ or for
optimizing the compilation of their class libraries.  Moreover,
OpenC++ is useful to develop a source-code analyzer such as one for
producing the class-inheritance graph of a C++ program.</P>

<P>
The programmer who want to use OpenC++ writes
a <I>meta-level</I> program, which specifies how to translate
or analyze a C++ program.  It is written in C++ and defines a small
number of classes.  Then the meta-level program is compiled by the
OpenC++ compiler and (dynamically or statically) linked to the compiler
itself as a compiler
plug-in.  The resulting compiler translates or analyzes
a source program (it is called a <I>base-level</I> program for
distinction) as the meta-level program specifies.  </P>



<P><IMG SRC="occ.gif"

<P>
The meta-level program is written according to the programming
interface called the OpenC++ MOP (Metaobject Protocol.)
Through this interface, the internal structure of the compiler is
exposed to the programmers with object-oriented abstraction.</P>

<P>
The base-level program is first preprocessed by the C++ preprocessor,
and then divided into small pieces of code.  These pieces of code are
translated by class metaobjects and assembled again into a complete C++
program.  In the OpenC++ MOP, the pieces of code is represented
by <CODE><B>Ptree</B></CODE> metaobjects in the form of parse tree (that is,
linked list).  Although the metaobjects are identical
to regular C++ objects, they exist in the compiler and
represent a meta aspect of the <I>base-level</I> program.  This
is why they are not simply
called <I>objects</I> but <I>metaobjects</I>.</P>

<P>
The class metaobject is selected 
according to the static type of the translated piece of code.
For example, if the piece of code is a member call on a <CODE><B>Point</B></CODE> object:</P>


<PRE><CODE>p0->move(3, 4)
</CODE></PRE>

<P>
Then it is translated by the class metaobject for <CODE><B>Point</B></CODE> (the type of <CODE><B>p0</B></CODE>.)  It is given to the class
metaobject in the form of parse tree and translated, for example,
into this;</P>


<PRE><CODE>(++counter, p0->move(3, 4))
</CODE></PRE>

<P>
This translation is similar to the one by Lisp macros, but
it is type-oriented.  The translation by the metaobjects is
applied not only a member call but also other kinds of code
involved with the C++ class system, such as data member access
and class declaration.</P>

<P>
The programmer who wants to customize the source-to-source
translation writes a meta-level program to define a new class
metaobject.  This class metaobject is associated with a particular
class in the base-level program and controls the translation of the code
involved with the class.  Thus the translation is applied only to the
particular class and the rest of the code involved with the other
classes remains <I>as is</I>.</P>

<P>
The class metaobject can use other aspects of the base-level
program during the source-code translation.  In addition to the
parse tree, it can access the semantic information such as static
types and class definitions.  These various aspects of the program
facilitates the implementation of complex source-code translation and
analysis.  Furthermore, the OpenC++ MOP enables syntax extensions
so that the base-level programmers can write annotations to help
the translation or the analysis.</P>

<P>
The meta architecture of OpenC++ might look very different
from the architecture
of other reflective languages.  However, note that the class metaobject
still controls the behavior of the base-level objects, which are instances
of the class.  The uniqueness of the OpenC++ MOP is only that the class
metaobject does not interpret the base-level program in the customized
way, but rather translates that program at compile time so that the
customized behavior is implemented.  The readers will find that, as in other
reflective languages, the class metaobject has a member function for
every basic action of the object, such as member calls, data reading/writing,
object creation, and so forth, for customizing the object behavior.</P>
