 2003-06-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o CreatePipe: create unique named pipe
                o CreateNamedPipe: fixed return value + wrong check for duplex pipe

 2003-05-29: Platon Fomichev <stauff@innotek   >
    - COMCTL32: o Listview selection draw code was not ok with OS/2 look

 2003-05-28: Platon Fomichev <stauff@innotek   >
    - COMCTL32: o OWNERDRAW fixes for ListView control

 2003-05-27: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Do not send WM_STYLECHANGING/ED messages when the scrollbar
                  control is shown or hidden.
                o PeekMessage fix (regression from 5-16)

 2003-05-26: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - COMCTL32: o Use the new resources from Wine.

 2003-05-26: Platon Fomichev <stauff@innotek   >
    - COMCTL32: o Listview selection draw code was incomplete due to resync.

 2003-05-26: Platon Fomichev <stauff@innotek   >
    - COMCTL32: o Patrick's 2001 fixes broke too much. Stay with ReWind for now.

 2003-05-23: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o ClearCommError: lpdwError is allowed to be NULL

 2003-05-16: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Use our fast critical sections instead of OS/2 mutex semaphores 
                  in the timer code.
                o Handle WM_(SYS)TIMER timer calls in DispatchMessageA/W.
                  We previously called timer handlers when we received WM_TIMER
                  from PM. That's not correct. These messages must be returned
                  by Get/PeekMessage. The handler will not be called if the 
                  timer message is not dispatched. (verified in NT4)

 2003-05-16: Platon Fomichev <stauff@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Eat first WM_MOUSEMOVE while menu tracking like windows does
                  to prevent 'auto-clicking' on popup menus that appear in the
                  area of first mouse-click

 2003-05-15: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Window creation: updated the coordinate fix code with the latest Rewind version
                o ReleaseDC: always verify window associated with DC
    - COMCTL32: o Complete resync with latest Wine (except draglist)
                o Implemented LVM_APPROXIMATEVIEWRECT for LVS_REPORT controls 
                  (needed to get rid of a crash; very likely to be incorrect)

 2003-05-14: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - GDI32:    o DIB section: do not fetch more colors from a bitmap header than 
                  biClrUsed (if != 0)
                o GetDIBits: save and restore negative height & log failure
    - USER32:   o Do not send any SetWindowPos related messages if the state
                  of the window doesn't change.

 2003-05-12: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o _lopen: wrong parsing of mode parameter
                  (only found now due to CreateFile changed with dwDesiredAccess)

 2003-05-07: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Added more members to the TEB structure

 2003-05-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Fixed closing of parent file handle by duplicate memory map
                o Compare file names instead of handles when checking for 
                  duplicate file maps.
    - USER32:   o ReleaseDC check if hwnd parameter is correct (WindowFromDC(hdc))
                o Messagebox: Wrong ReleaseDC call

 2003-05-06: knut st. osmundsen <bird-odin-spam@anduin   >
    - KERNEL32: o Corrected the handling of OF_PARSE in OpenFile.

 2003-05-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Handle files opened with 0 for dwDesiredAccess seperately.
                  Those handles can only be used with a limited nr of functions
                  (such as GetFileType/Size/Time)
    - IPHLPAPI: o Implemented GetIpAddrTable, GetIfTable & GetFriendlyIfIndex

 2003-05-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Keep track of all open window DCs
                o During WM_VRNENABLED we must query the visible region
                  of all open DCs to ensure that GPI updates the visible
                  region (e.g. when a window has moved).
                  A bug in PM/GPI causes open DCs to get out of sync when
                  moving windows with full window drag enabled.
                  (without full window drag there is no such problem due
                   to the use of LockWindowUpdate)

 2003-04-30: Platon Fomichev <stauff@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o In WM_PARENTNOTIFY correctly map window coordinates for each
                  window we send this message to.
                  Correctly finish PM minimize sequence.
                  Correctly switch titlebar higlight on activate/deactivate.

 2003-04-30: Dietrich Teickner <Dietrich_Teickner@t-online   >
    - SHLWAPI:  o Fixed PathIsUrlA/W
    - KERNEL32: o Changed dll renaming to include extension if it's not .dll
    - ODIN.INI: o Update for kernel32 change
                  (IMPORTANT: must update your odin.ini with this one or
                              delete the current file)

 2003-04-27: Platon Fomichev <stauff@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Correctly finish PM restore procedure from minimized state.
                o Use Stock brush for minimized icon fill when it is not
                  allocated.

 2003-04-25: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - NTDLL:    o Initialize kernel32 first (circular dependency between 
                  kernel32 & ntdll)

 2003-04-25: knut st. osmundsen <bird-odin-spam@anduin   >
    - USER32:   o Fake window subclass FS bugfix.

 2003-04-24: knut st. osmundsen <bird-odin-spam@anduin   >
    - USER32:   o Fake window init bugfixes

 2003-04-24: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o EndDialog: Enable owner window regardless of whether it was
                             enabled before dialog creation. When the owner
                             is disabled and we hide the dialog, then PM switches
                             focus to another application. (hidden windows cannot
                             have focus)
                o Win32BaseWindow::GetWindowFromOS2Handle: also check fake
                  windows)

 2003-04-24: Platon Fomichev <stauff@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Fixed restore/maximize from minimized state for MDI windows.

 2003-04-15: knut st. osmundsen <bird-odin-spam@anduin   >
    - USER32:   o Properties allocated from shared memory.
                o Fake window updates.

 2003-04-15: knut st. osmundsen <bird-odin-spam@anduin   >
    - src/makefile:
                o Build NTDLL too. (netlabs only)

 2003-04-14: knut st. osmundsen <bird-odin-spam@anduin   >
    - USER32:   o Implemented SW_SHOWDEFAULT.
    - KERNEL32: o Changed initialization of StartupInfo to take the actual
                  values of the CreateProcess call (but for the strings).
                  (not complete)

 2003-04-11: knut st. osmundsen <bird-odin-spam@anduin   >
    - USER32, KERNEL32, include/win/thread.h:
                o Implemented WM_COPYDATA.

 2002-04-11: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Send WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED for ShowWindow(SW_SHOWWINDOW)
                o Tool windows (WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW) don't have minimize or maximize
                  buttons. (testing shows this in NT4)
                o Changed default hittest handler to check for WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW
                  (system menu & min/max buttons)
                o MENU_TrackKbdMenuBar: check for WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW before using
                  the system menu.
                o Display tool window titlebars in win32 style. They are supposed
                  to be thinner than standard PM titlebar controls.

 2003-04-11: Dmitry Froloff <froloff@os2   >
    - KERNEL32: o Console updates

 2003-04-10: Platon Fomichev <stauff@innotek   >
    - MSVCRT  : o MSVCRT updates, forwarders to stdcall functions, lots of funcs
                  now directly imported from NTDLL, resync with latest Wine
    - EMXLIBS : o Added yet another wrapper for FS and added some funcs for new
                  msvcrt
    - INCLUDE : o OS2SEL functions corrected for potential optimizing problems
                  in release build. (Bug found and corrected by Dietrich)

 2002-04-09: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Unmap memory view when deleting PE dll object.
                  (problem found by Dietrich)

 2003-04-09: Platon Fomichev <stauff@innotek   >
    - COMCTL32: o Due to flaw in cdecl implementation of GCC temporary
                  correctly import _wtoi func from NTDLL
    - EMXLIBS:  o Possible endless loop in OS2FS replacement funcs
                  (problem found by Dietrich)

 2003-04-08: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Treat LBUTTON press different from others in scrollbar. (WineX resync)

 2002-04-08: knut st. osmundsen <Knut.Osmundsen@innotek   >
    - COMDLG32: o Corrected default printer init. It was crashing with big
                  printer setups and not handling multiple drivers per device
                  correctly.

 2002-04-08: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Menu control: do not paint default menu item strings in bold
                                if in OS/2 GUI mode

 2003-04-04: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - NTDLL:    o Massive update. NTDLL internal tests, almost all
                  string and conversion funcs. Corrected and beautified .def file
    - DOC:      o Updated GCCBuildInstructions.txt for GCC 3.2.1

 2003-04-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - WINMM:    o Different method for detecting DirectAudio (uniaud, sblive, c-media)
                o Added custom build function to disable DirectAudio (always use DART)
                o Waveout (DART): handle underrun properly (next buffer write
                  and position after continueing)

 2002-04-02: knut st. osmundsen <bird-odin-spam@anduin   >
    - WIN32K:   o Win32VersionValue in OptionalHeader.

 2002-04-02: Yuri Dario <mc6530@mclink   >
    - INCLUDE, GDI32, USER32, KERNEL32:
                o Corrected & changed headers + source updates
    - USER32:   o Button: WM_SETTEXT fix

 2003-04-02: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - INCLUDE, KERNEL32:
                o Corrected HFILE definition as it is in Wine and in Win2k +
                  header updates.
    - INCLUDE\EMXRUNTIME:

    - LIB\EMXSUPPORT:
                o Modified EMX libraries

 2003-04-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - GDI32:    o Fix for partial dibsection resyncs

 2003-04-01: Platon Fomichev <stauff@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Functions for setting custom frame/cd/window class names

 2003-03-31: Dietrich Teickner <Dietrich_Teickner@t-online   >
    - SHELL32:  o Shell file operations update

 2003-03-31: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Added vsnprintfW/snprintfW funcs for syncing with latest
                  wine NTDLL

 2003-03-31: knut st. osmundsen <bird-odin-spam@anduin   >
    - PE2LX/WIN32K:
                o Custombuild feature for excluding dlls. Cleanups.
                o Option for making all object RW file.
    - KERNEL32: o Made Pe2Lx'ed DLLs work.

 2003-03-28: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Removed changes for window tracking (move/size) with full
                  window dragging enabled (2003-03-27)

 2003-03-27: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Don't change focus when processing mouse button message if
                  the top parent is a fake window
                o Changes for window tracking (move/size) with full window
                  dragging enabled
    - KERNEL32: o Memory map updates

 2003-03-26: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o WaitForSingleObject/(Msg)WaitForMultipleObject fixes to
                  prevent thread priorities from being accidentally boosted to
                  time critical

 2003-03-22: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o If an application doesn't validate the update region
                  while processing WM_PAINT, then we must remember it for
                  the next time.
                  Windows will only send a WM_PAINT once until another part of
                  the window is invalidated. Unfortunately PM keeps on sending
                  WM_PAINT messages until we validate the update region.
                  This affects UpdateWindow, RedrawWindow, GetUpdateRgn, GetUpdateRect,
                  BeginPaint and the next WM_PAINT message.

 2003-03-20: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o WindowFromPoint: only send WM_NCHITTEST to windows belonging
                  to the current thread
                o Changes for fake windows. Moved them into a seperate C++ class
                  and overload some methods to correct the behaviour.

 2003-03-18: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Shift/Ctrl/Alt+Numpad keys illegal behaviour. Generic numpad
                  keys like (/*-+) produced garbage.

 2003-03-12: Platon Fomichev <stauff@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o GetKeyState and GetAsyncKeyState fixes for numpad keyboard

 2003-03-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Don't change the stack alignment if the thread has less than
                  128 kb stack.
    - WINMM:    o Improved accuracy of waveIn/OutGetPosition. (use FPU to prevent
                  rounding errors)
                o Added code to dump played wave data to disk (disabled by default)

 2003-03-06: knut st. osmundsen <Knut.Osmundsen@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o The WIN32LOG_FILEBASE env.var. can be used to point the logfile
                  elsewhere. "%d.log" is added to the value.
                o Print szLineExceptionType too in exception dump.
                o Custombuild apis for entering and leaving Odin thread context.
                o Added functions to quickly get the PID & TID

 2003-03-05: knut st. osmundsen <bird-odin-spam@anduin   >
    - MAKE:     o Experimental OTHERS variable.
                o Full source path to compilers.

 2003-03-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - WINMM:    o timeBegin/EndPeriod: check for upper and lower boundaries
                o waveoutGetPosition: return 0 if stream is not active (DART)
                o waveinGetPosition: return 0 if stream is not active (DART)
                o Don't print a warning for CALLBACK_NULL callbacks
                o Added ODIN_waveInSetFixedBuffers, renamed SetFixedWaveBufferSize
                  to ODIN_waveOutSetFixedBuffers. Used to tell WINMM to use
                  the waveOutWrite buffer size for the DART buffers.
                o Don't pause the wave stream if no buffers left to add. Let
                  DART detect the underrun condition.

 2003-03-04: Platon Fomichev <stauff@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o We did not pay attention to numlock state on numpad keyboard.

 2003-03-03: Dietrich Teickner <Dietrich_Teickner@t-online   >
    - GDI32:    o ExtTextOutA: copy string and force zero termination
    - SHELL32:  o Minor updates

 2003-03-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - WSOCK32:  o Removed wrong checks for invalid address parameters in
                  sendto & recvfrom

 2003-03-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o ExitProcess: turn off hard errors & exception popups before
                  calling O32_ExitProcess (release build only)
                o DeleteFile: when deleting a .lnk file, verify if it's a shell
                  link object file. if so, delete WPS object
                o ODIN_DisableFolderShellLink added: disable object creation in
                  Odin folder. Desktop shortcuts will still be created as WPS
                  objects on the desktop.
                o OSLibWinCreateObject: create shelllink file with WPS object id
    - USER32/KERNEL32:
                o Move OSLibWinCreateObject to KERNEL32
    - SHELL32:  o Shelllink: use kernel32 file functions instead of those from
                  the VAC crt

 2003-02-28: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - SRC\makefile:
                o Skip msvcrt & crtdll for now. Causes too many problems with
                  Odin builds.
    - KERNEL32: o Fixed CreateProcessA regression (Lotus Notes)
                o Check for invalid data while measuring the CPU speed. DosTmrQueryTime
                  isn't very reliable (on laptops).
                o ExitProcess: don't remove our exception handler too early
                o Map ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND (OS/2) to ERROR_INVALID_NAME
    - WINMM:    o Protect linked timer list with VMutex object.

 2003-02-28: knut st. osmundsen <Knut.Osmundsen@innotek   >
    - MAKEFILES:
                o New rule cleanall which tries to wipe out all the output.
                o ODIN32_LIB and ODIN32_BIN is now the same for all the CCENVs.
                  (AFAIK we no longer try compile stuff with many compiles, but
                   stick too the once which are working, VAC3 or EMX that is.)
                o Linenumbers in release mode.
                o Pass full source file names to compilers so the debugger easier
                  will find the the right source.
                o Defined STATIC_CRT in src/win32k/utils.
                o Profiling: Link with kProfile.lib when DEBUG= and PROFILE=1.
                  Configured this for EMX targets too. (state: Experimental)

 2003-02-28: Platon Fomichev <stauff@innotek   >
    - USER32: o Wrong checks on restoration point remembering. Maximizing
                window from PM icon using keyboard or menu produced wrong
                controls.

 2003-02-27: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o VirtualAlloc: fixed handling of commit for a page range
                  that is not entirely reserved (contains committed pages)
                o Don't call WinMessageBox in the unhandled exception filter as
                  that can hang PM.

    - USER32:   o Illegal PM sequence of maximizing from icon state corrected.
                  Inter-thread controls change caused PM lockups. Rewrote
                  PM window frame controls manipulation procedure.

 2000-02-27: Achim Hasenmueller <achimha@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o MoveFile: detect if source and target file names are on a
                  different drive and use DosCopy/DosDelete instead of DosMove
                  in this case.

 2003-02-26: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - RICHED32: o Rewrote control; no longer creates a child Edit window as this
                  doesn't happen in Windows and breaks subclassing
                o EM_CHARFROMPOS is different for RichEdit controls (lParam is
                  a POINTL pointer)
                o Implemented EM_FINDWORDBREAK

 2003-02-25: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Bugfix for WPS object creation
    - RICHED32: o Added support for EM_SETCHARFORMAT (text & background color)

    - WSOCK32:  o check for local host name in gethostbyname. if identical,
                  then use "localhost" instead
    - KERNEL32: o GetFullPathNameA: don't change the input string
                o Added ODIN_IsWin32App export to determine whether an app
                  is a win32 or os2 binary.
    - USER32:   o Changes for creating WPS objects (win32/os2 app)
                o Added function to convert an icon group in memory
    - SHELL32:  o Convert win32 icon file to os2 format when creating a shell link.

 2003-02-23: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin   >
    - TOOLS/ALIASDEF:
                o A tool for generating alias records from an .def file.
                  Something I wrote will playing with NTDLL here.

 2003-02-22: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - WS2_32:   o Added WSARecv(From) & WSASend(To) stubs

 2003-02-22: Platon Fomichev <stauff@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Restoring maximized window from iconic state caused window
                  frame controls to behave badly. General out-of-sync problems
                  with frame controls. Invisibility of frame controls after
                  lots of minimizing/restoring.

 2003-02-22: Dietrich Teickner <Dietrich_Teickner@t-online   >

 2003-02-18: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Touch last stack page using ESP. (just in case)
                o Cleaned up memory map code.

 2003-02-17: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o FindFirstFile: return ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND if DosFindFirst
                  returns ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND
    - USER32:   o Single Alt down + up always generates WM_SYSKEYUP; reset
                  iMenuSysKey on WM_KEYUP, so the system menu isn't accidentally
                  activated.

 2003-02-16: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o ToAscii: fixed wrong checks for VK_SHIFT/CONTROL/MENU
                o Fixed broken implementation of GetKeyState, GetAsyncKeyState
                  and GetKeyboardState
                o Do not translate WM_KEYUP to WM_SYSKEYUP if AltGr released
                  and KC_LONEKEY flag is set. (only for Alt)
                o GetKeyboardState, GetKeyState, GetAsyncKeyState:
                  pretend left Ctrl key is pressed if AltGr down.
    - PMKBDHK:  o Special handling of AltGr key. Must send Ctrl key messages
                  like Windows.

 2003-02-14: Dietrich Teickner <Dietrich_Teickner@t-online   >
    - SHELL32:  o Shell file operation updates

 2003-02-13: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Handle SetFocus(0) correctly: keystrokes are converted into
                  WM_SYSKEYDOWN/(WM_SYSCHAR)/WM_SYSKEYUP messages
                o DrawFocusRect: conflict between SetROP2(R2_XORPEN) and
                  SetBkMode(TRANSPARENT); commenting out the latter for now.
    - SHELL32:  o Control panel Wine resync
    - KERNEL32: o Added ODIN_SetTIBSwitch function to override TIB selector
                  switching.
                o Forward RtlZero/Move/FillMemory to ntdll
    - NTDLL:    o Cleaned up

 2003-02-11: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o When a window is activated by a mouse click, we must set
                  focus to the client window (and not the frame!).
                o GetSysColor: always return cached colors

 2003-02-10: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Touch all stack pages we skip in the out of stack workaround for
                  16 bits code. Jumping over the guard page causes a protection
                  violation exception.
    - USER32:   o EnumThreadWindows: must return windows in Z-order
                  (experiments show EnumThreadWindows in NT4 behaves like this)

 2003-02-07: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - DDRAW/NTDLL:
                o Rename resource directory
    - USER32:   o Don't save position (for restore) in SetWindowPos if window
                  is minimized .

 2002-02-06: Dietrich Teickner <Dietrich_Teickner@t-online   >
    - USER32:   o Edit control: fixed heap corruption in undo buffer

 2003-02-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - ODINCRT:  o Rewrote critical sections to be safe on SMP systems
                  (previous implementation had one flaw that happened
                   to be triggered often on my SMP machine)
    - USER32:   o Edit control: Always kill the timer if in captured state.
                  The app can call ReleaseCapture before we get the WM_LBUTTONUP
                  message.
                o Send WM_QUERYNEWPALETTE when a window receives focus
                o Translate WM_REALIZEPALETTE into WM_PALETTECHANGED
    - GDI32:    o Must manually correct y coordinates for DIB section blit since
                  we reset the y inversion back to 0.
                  (subtract twice the viewport & windows origin y)
                o CreateDIBSection: don't get palette from DC if bitmap bits provided

 2003-02-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Check ESP when calling the entrypoint of a newly created thread.
                  If close to a 64kb boundary, adjust it. Some ancient 16 bits
                  code will crash if there's not enough stack left.

 2003-02-04: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Support DuplicateHandle for threads
                o Fixed command line parsing regression

                  and command line strings

 2003-01-29: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o OS/2 Look & Feel is now default
                o Use OS/2 colors again in OS/2 L&F mode

                  convention in headers for GCC. Bugs in ASM code for SetFS
                  RestoreFS.
    - NTDLL:    o In C++ files specify extern "C" for _System calling convention
                  as well. Affected _DLL_InitTerm

 2003-01-23: knut st. osmundsen <bird-odin-spam@anduin.net>
    - TOOLS\COMMON, TOOLS\WRC\U:
                o Define STATIC_CRT so wrapper headers doesn't kick in.

 2003-01-23: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - INCLUDE\*.mk:
                o Don't use include\incl_vac for statically linked targets
                  (e.g. tools)
    - ODINCRT:  o Added wrappers for new & delete operators
    - ODINPROF, IPLOG, OLE32\REGSVR32;
                o Link with static CRT library
    - MAKE\setup.mak:
                o Only add include\incl_vac if not building an odin32 app

 2003-01-23: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - DOC:      o Added build instructions for GCC
    - NTDLL:    o Made initntdll a C file to remove C++ GCC stuff for now
                  and added RtlBitmap support from Wine.
    - INCLUDE:  o Correced odinlx.h header - problem while compiling with
                  C compiler.

 2003-01-22: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - ODINCRT:  o Renamed wrapper functions
    - INCLUDE\incl_vac:
                o Changed VAC headers to rename memory and file functions
                  (those that change FS when called)
    - MAKE, INCLUDE\*.mk:
                o Add include\incl_vac first to include path (/I)
    - KERNEL32: o Removed WriteLogError

 2003-01-21: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - DDRAW:    o Removed dependency on dive.dll. Load it on demand.
    - USER32:   o Moved debug wrapper for DDE to dde.cpp

 2003-01-19: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Only load LVM.DLL when we actually need it.
                o CreateProcess bugfix for thread id if launched directly
                o CreateFile returns ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS if file not found
                  and CREATE_NEW
                o Check and correct process type in thread wrapper. WinCreateMsgQueue
                  fails for non-PM apps. We set it to PM in the VIO loader, but
                  apparently it can be changed back.

 2003-01-18: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o FindFirstFile must return ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND when
                  the specified file or directory isn't present.
                  (OS/2 returns ERROR_NO_MORE_FILES)

 2003-01-16: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Fixed heap corruption in CreateProcess (with current dir)
    - USER32:   o Only the combo bitmap header is wrong; the others are fine
                  (regression from 2003-01-05)

 2003-01-16: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >

 2003-01-13: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Don't allocate selectors anymore. Allocate tiled memory
                  and call Dos32FlatToSel.
                o Get default stack size from PE header.
                o Thread handles not closed properly.

                  flag set.
                o Implemented Set/GetHandleInformation
                o CreateFile: create handles that are not inherited by child
                              processes by default
                              Only enable inheritance if specified in security struct
                o Create(Named)Pipe: default = not inherited by child processes
                                     Only enable inheritance if specified in security
                                     struct.
                o DuplicateHandle; set inheritance flag with SetHandleInformation
                o CreateProcess: support for setting stdin/out/err handles
                                 of child process
                o PeekNamedPipe: - return ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE when used for unnamed

 2003-01-10: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - MSVCRT:   o Updates
    - CRTDLL:   o Wine port (forwarder dll to msvcrt)

 2003-01-10: Herwig Bauernfeind <herwig.bauernfeind@aon   >
    - ODINBUG:  o Updated to version 0.5.8

 2003-01-08: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >

                  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation
                o GetTimeZoneInformation: read info from registery if present;
                  otherwise call WGSS
                o RegQueryValue(Ex)W: workaround to return bytes for strings

                  resize the Edit child in the WM_SIZE handler.
                o Wrong call to ctordtorTerm; removed it and ctordtorInit
                  since there's no C++ code in that dll anyway.
    - ODININST: o Parse TZ environment variable and save timezone information
                  to the registry. (default is CET if not found)

 2003-01-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - WSOCK32:  o Better method to cancel all async requests in WSACleanup
    - USER32:   o Invalidate window when it's resized and SWP_NOCOPYBITS
                  is specified.
                o Fixed icon leak in IconForWindow method (call LoadImageA
                  with LR_SHARED flag to reuse icons)

 2003-01-06: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - ConfigureGCC.cmd,
      INCLUDE\win\msvcrt,
      INCLUDE\emx makefiles
      MSVCRT:

 2003-01-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Added ODIN_SetDllLoadCallback; install a dll load hook
                  that's called as soon as all exports are processed
                  (so before any code is executed that can use the dll)
                o Added ODIN_SetProcAddress; override a name or ordinal export
    - USER32:   o Corrected wrong bitmap headers in resources
                o Added workaround for handling black & white cursors

 2002-01-05: Dietrich Teickner <Dietrich_Teickner@t-online   >
    - USER32:   o Return MA_NOACTIVATE in listbox WM_MOUSEACTIVATE handler.
                  (apparently not necessary anymore in Wine; so probably
                   caused by something else)

 2003-01-04: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Corrected drawing of menubar in OS/2 L&F mode (when highlighted)
                o Fixed handling of single ALT to select menu

    - GDI32:    o Removed broken handling of TA_RIGHT in TextOut
                o Flip bitmap in GetDIBits if height is negative
                o Only return bitfield data in GetDIBits if compression set
                  to BI_BITFIELDS (and lpvBits is not NULL)

 2003-01-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Merged Rewind menu control
                o Fixed GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXMENUCHECK); should be 13
                o Always use windows system colors (even in OS/2 L&F mode)

 2002-01-03: Dietrich Teickner <Dietrich_Teickner@t-online   >
    - KERNEL32: o Convert timezone names in Set/GetTimeZoneInformation as
                  WGSS expects/returns ascii strings instead of unicode.

 2003-01-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Set the codepage of the message queue for each new thread
                  that is created. (done for the main thread in user32)
    - USER32:   o Fix for composite keyboard character translation
                  (e.g. ^ on german keyboards)
                o SystemParametersInfoA fix for SPI_GETNONCLIENTMETRICS in
                  OS/2 L&F (font height must be negative)
                o Deactivate window when hiding it to force PM to switch focus.
                  (Note: might cause regressions!)
                o Fixed behaviour of SetFocus(NULL); should return the current
                  focus window.

 2003-01-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Fixes for windows with an iconless class and WS_EX_DLGMODALFRAME
                  style. (they shouldn't have a system menu)
                  (either right after creation or when the app add this extended
                   style later on)
                o Remove minimize or maximize controls when the app requests it
                  (OS/2 GUI mode)
    - GDI32:    o Cleaned up SetDIBitsToDevice
