    - KERNEL32: o Added read & write functions to custom driver interface
                o OdinSetVersion added to override windows version reported by
                  Odin (Win98, WinME, NT4, Win2000, WinXP)
                o New versions available for odin.ini version override
                  [WinVersion]
                  Version=Win98        -> Windows 98
                  Version=WinME        -> Windows ME
                  Version=NT4          -> Windows NT4  SP6 (default)
                  Version=Win2000      -> Windows 2000 SP2
                  Version=WinXP        -> Windows XP
                o IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_MEDIA_TYPES is identical to 
                  IOCTL_DISK_GET_MEDIA_TYPES
                o Support for Windows 2000 GetVersionEx extension (OSVERSIONINFOEX
                  structure) added
                o Added symbolic link for Windows 2000 device driver names
                  \\.\Global -> \\.
                o Clear GENERIC_WRITE flag if application tries to open
                  readonly device (e.g. cdrom). This is not allowed in OS/2.
    - INSTALL:  o Add font mapping for 'MS Shell Dlg 2' to WarpSans

 2001-12-07: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o GetFileType for parallel port device returns FILE_TYPE_PIPE
                  (verified in NT4, SP6)
                o Comm functions not valid for parallel port handles
                o Overlapped IO updates
                o Com port now uses new overlapped class for overlapped IO
                o Call ExitProcess when executable entrypoint returns (LX images)
                o Be careful when cleaning up threads after ExitProcess has
                  been called

 2001-12-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Added FindFirstFileExA/FindFirstFileExW
                o Overlapped IO updates (still untested)
    - DINPUT:   o Link with guidlib.lib
    - GUIDLIB:  o Include dinput.h for DirectInput GUIDs

 2001-12-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Merged WriteFile & WriteFileEx, ReadFile & ReadFileEx
                  handle manager functions
                o Removed dwType handle manager structure member; added
                  win32 handle to structure
                  (NOTE: All work in progress for new framework for overlapped IO)
                o ReadFileEx/WriteFileEx: lpOverlapped->Offset & lpOverlapped->OffsetHigh 
                  must be 0 if used with named pipes

 2001-12-04: Patrick Haller <patrick.haller@innotek.de>
    - KERNEL32: o parallel port support restricted to physical ports
                  (LAN redirections not supported)

 2001-12-04: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - COMCTL32: o Hack added for proper resizing of wizard property sheet in
                  CVP. Not sure if it's always correct or whether it has a
                  bad effect on other apps (none found so far).
    - WININET:  o HttpSendRequestA fix: strlen(NULL) crashes

 2001-12-03: Patrick Haller <patrick.haller@innotek.de>
    - KERNEL32: o put in correct ioctl identifiers for parport support
                  in winioctl.h
                o parallel port support (hardware configuration) enabled

 2001-12-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Use DosSleep in Sleep (don't call WGSS)
                o GetThreadPriority: return priority stored in TEB
                o Rewrote SetThreadPriority; allow it to change priority
                  classes too. WGSS only changes delta in SetThreadPriority
                  and class in SetPriorityClass (but that one affects the whole 
                  process, so it is rarely used by applications)
                  THREAD_PRIORITY_IDLE          -> PRTYC_IDLETIME, 0 
                  THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST        -> PRTYC_REGULAR, PRTYD_MINIMUM
                  THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL  -> PRTYC_REGULAR, -15
                  THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL        -> PRTYC_REGULAR, 0
                  THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL  -> PRTYC_REGULAR, 15
                  THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST       -> PRTYC_REGULAR, PRTYD_MAXIMUM
                  THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL -> PRTYC_TIMECRITICAL, 0
                o SetPriorityClass; just return success for now

 2001-12-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Don't send WM_SIZE message to dialog before it receives
                  WM_INITDIALOG
                  (winzip 8.0 and Opera crash when sending this message too soon)
                  (TODO: check in NT if this is really correct)
    - COMCTL32: o Restored old property sheet code as latest Wine version
                  causes too many new problems.

 2001-12-01: knut st. osmundsen <kosmunds@csc.com>
    - CRTDLL:   o Include ctype.h from dir.c and string.c. (Noted by Ye][ow.)

 2001-12-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Fixed GetThreadTEB macro & GetCurrentThreadId
                  (completely broke debug build among other things)

 2000-12-01: Yuri Dario <mc6530@mclink.it>
    - USER32:   o MENU_FindItem: extra check added for loops in menus
