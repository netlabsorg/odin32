    - USER32:   o Mouse message translation fix (check capture)
                o Turn off WS_CAPTION style for dialogs with DS_CONTROL flag set
                  (fixes file dialogs with OFN_ENABLETEMPLATE style)
                  Verified behaviour in NT4, SP6 with DSShow sample
                  - about dialog with DS_CONTROL -> no titlebar
                  - file open dialog without DS_CONTROL -> titlebar + moveable
                    2nd dialog                   
                o Temporary workaround for file dialogs with template dialog child.
                  They don't redraw when switching directories. For some reason
                  the new child's (syslistview32) update rectangle stays empty 
                  after its parent is made visible with ShowWindow
                  TODO: find real cause
    - MSACM32:  o Ported latest Wine version
    - WINMM:    o Ported latest Wine driver.c (necessary for msacm32 update)
    - DDRAW:    o Back buffer fix; setup surface descriptor structure and
                  don't clear DDSCAPS_BACKBUFFER flag
                  (fix for WinDVD)
                o SurfLock:  hEvent can be 0 as long as the DDLOCK_EVENT flag 
                  isn't set.
                  Size of lpSurfaceDesc can be sizeof(DDSURFACEDESC2).
                  (fix for WinDVD)
    - KERNEL32: o Check executable type (VIO/GUI) in CreateProcess and launch
                  correct version of the pe loader (PE/PEC)
