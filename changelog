    - Include\uniconv.h
                FS wrappers for Unicode api
    - Include\heapstring.h:
                strcasecmp & strncasecmp are case insensitive (fixes
                profile apis (and probably some other things too))
    - KERNEL32: Calculate cpu speed and set HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\CentralProcessor\x\~Mhz key
                Added GetFileType method to conin/out which return FILE_TYPE_CHAR
                Create new keys during installation:
                [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Cdfs]
                [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Cdrom]
                Fix for failure during DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH for LX system
                dlls (pe loader). Didn't fail properly before.
    - USER32:   Fix for EDIT_WM_Char (couldn't type in numbers anymore)
                EnumDisplaySettingsA accepts negative indices
    - ADVAPI32: Cleanup

 2000-10-03: Michal Necasek <mike@mendelu.cz>
    - KERNEL32: Fix for HMGetFileType. Must return FILE_TYPE_CHAR for standard
                handles (in/out/error)

 2000-10-03: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Watcom makefiles:
                ú Wrote a converter tool to make wlink input from .def files.
                  tools/common - kDef2Wat.exe (Need VA C to compiler currently)
                ú Found a problem with Watcom when trying to link
                  advapi32.dll; It mangles the __stdcall function when
                  they aren't prototyped/delcared extern "C". Haven't found
                  any solution to this, other than prototyping the
                  APIs within extern "C" { }.

 2000-10-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - SHLWAPI:  Rewrote VERSION_OsIsUnicode (same as SHELL_OsIsUnicode now)
    - RICHED32: 'Handle' WM_SETTEXT messages. Wine's richedit dll is very
                incomplete. It's better to use the native windows version.
    - KERNEL32: Ported Wine's LoadModule (previously used Open32)
                Changed version apis
                You can now tell Odin to pretend to be Windows 98 or 
                Windows NT 4.0 (default = NT40)
                Odin.ini:
                [WinVersion]
                Version=Win98
    - OLE32:    Added stubs for CoGetInstanceFromFile & CoGetInstanceFromIStorage
    - KERNEL32, WSOCK32, WINMM, include\odinwrap.h, SHLWAPI, WNASPI32
                Changes/fixes for new ODINFUNCTION macros

 2000-10-02: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
    - *:        major change in ODINWRAP macros
                and (all) affected sources
    - GDI32:    fixed possible error in text.cpp (strrchr)
    - WNETAP32: started implementation of LAN Manager support :)
                NetApiBuffer*
                NetStatisticsGet
                NetWkstaGetInfo
    - KERNEL32: added HEAP_size export

 2000-10-02: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - KERNEL32: Fixed Pe2Lx (ie. Win32k) TLS problem. Beyond Compare works.
    - Common:   Added very limited dump capability to kFilePE. (Used to
                understand TLS.)
    - Win32k    Added symbols for kernel 14050 (Warp4) and
                14054 (Warp4, WS4eB SMP and UNI).

 2000-10-01: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
    - KERNEL32: Optimization of PROFILE calls
    - GDI32:    Fix for uncompressed/RGB bitmaps (biSizeImage == 0)
    - WINMM:    Fix for timer logic - timers still quite untested

 2000-10-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: Fixed bug introduced by recent command line changes
                (executables with spaces in name/dir)
    - GDI32:    Implemented AddFontResourceW

 2000-10-01: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   ú Added IOCtl API for Reading or Writing into another process'
                  address space. (*ProcessReadWrite)
                  This is intended used to implemented ReadProcessMemory and
                  WriteProcessMemory (which is essensial to debuggers I think).
                  I'll implementet them soon, but it sees that it'll
                  require more changes in process.c that I first thought.
                ú Simplified maintaince of kernel imports. (mkcalltab)
                  Removed unused imports.
