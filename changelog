 2000-08-14: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: Fixed sharing violation errors in OSLibDosCreateFile
                (FILE_SHARE_DELETE now included in share flag var)
                (fixes error messages when playing files in RealPlayer 7)

 2000-08-13: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
    - COMCTL32: added propsheet, treeview Corel WINE 20000807 changes
    - GDI32: activated WinDrawText code

 2000-08-12: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: Do not set OPEN_ACCESS_READWRITE flag in OSLibDosCreateFile
                (if OPEN_ACTION_CREATE_IF_NEW & readonly access)
                This was causing access denied errors (using FILE_SHARE_WRITE
                on a file on a readonly volume was not causing this; that's allowed)
                Removed share mode hack. Caused by the bug mentioned above.
                (You can change the file sharing mode when opening the same
                 file several times in OS/2)
                Fixed system dll unload bug.
                Extra checks in Win32ImageBase::isPEImage (nr of bytes read is correct or not)

 2000-08-11: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: Lock/Unlock
                64 bits values are only supported by JFS
                Try the 32 bits DosSetFileLocks if it fails with ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER
                (TODO: should check the partition type instead)
                Build fake dll header for system dlls and use it's address
                as instance handle.
                VIRTUAL_MapFileA/W: open file in share read/write mode
                Fixed  HMDuplicateHandle (check for DUPLICATE_ACCESS_READWRITE)
                LoadLibraryExA: if dll name = executable name of current process
                -> return handle of exe
                (GrandPrix 3 installer does this; verified in NT)
                FreeLibrary: if handle = exe handle of current process -> ignore
    - SRC\*\initterm.cpp
                Changed RegisterLxDll call for fake headers.
    - INCLUDE\misc.h:
                Removed versionos2.h dependancy
    - VERSION\version.cpp
                Include versionos2.h
    - COMCTL32: Put back old property page code (breaks VPBuddy preferences
                dialog). SameTime install property sheet now messed up (again).

 2000-08-10: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
    - KERNEL32: OSLibDosQueryVolumeFS does no more return an error if
                the caller is not interested in the volume name.
                Console Input handling improved, some correction.
                SetConsoleTitleW fixed.
          NOTE! lstrcpynAtoW and lstrcpynWtoA do no more enforce (erroneous)
                string termination.
                NT4's CMD.EXE is quite working now.

 2000-08-09: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: TLS changes (now updates THDB array instead of calling
                Open32)

 2000-08-09: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
    - COMCTL32: added language dependent resources

 2000-08-08: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
    - COMCTL32: first part of Corel WINE 20000807 changes

 2000-08-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - doc\ReportingBugs.txt:
                Added a little more information
    - tools\install
                Add Logging.txt + symbol files to debug build.

 2000-08-04: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: Temporary workaround for differences in share mode between
                OS/2 & NT (for opening the same file multiple times):
                NT: CreateFile with FILE_SHARE_READ
                    CreateFile with FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE
                    -> 2nd CreateFile overrides share flags of first one
                    -> CreateFile with GENERIC_WRITE is now allowed
                OS2: DosOpen with OPEN_SHARE_DENYWRITE
                     DosOpen with OPEN_SHARE_DENYNONE
                     -> sharing violation; can't change share flags while
                        handle returned by 1st DosOpen isn't closed
                --> 'Solution': always open files in FILE_SHARE_DENYNONE mode
                (several installation programs depend on this behaviour)

 2000-08-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: Create x:\Program Files & x:\Program Files\Common Files
                directories in odininst.exe + extra registry keys:
                [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion]
                "ProgramFilesDir"="x:\Program Files"
                "CommonFilesDir"="x:\Program Files\Common Files"
                "SharedDir"="x:\Odin"
    - COMCTL32: Fixed property page bugfix (wrong position) (by merging
                latest PROPSHEET_ShowPage from Wine)
    - DOC\ToDo.txt:
                Added:
                KERNEL32: Build fake PE headers for odin dlls (dll handle must be pointer to header)
                          (some applications use the handles as pointers)
