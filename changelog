 2000-05-18: Michal Necasek <mike@mendelu.cz>
    - DSOUND:   An updated version, hopefully not too many bugs were introduced

 2000-05-18: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: EnumResourceNamesA bugfix (wrong length in UnicodeToAsciiN call)
                (reported by Michal Necasek)
                Call CheckLogException for each exception; safety guard against
                exceptions inside WriteLog.
    - WSOCK32:  Mark cancelled async select to avoid finding it before the
                thread removes itself from the queue
                Check if async select thread is blocking inside select before
                calling so_cancel to cancel or change the async select.
    - SHELL32:  Removed Path* functions; added forwarders to shlwapi.dll
    - SHLWAPI:  Merged path function with Wine 20000430 (shellpath.cpp)

                SHFindComputer + other apis used by IE5 (stubs)
    - COMCTL32: Added export 389 (return 0 as in NT 4) & 390 (stub); IE5 needs them
                Added DPA_LoadStream & DPA_SaveStream (Wine port)

 2000-05-16: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - COMDLG32: Fixed shlwapi imports (GetProcAddress failed for PathFindFileNameA
                -> crash when calling file dialog functions)

 2000-05-16: Jeroen van den Horn <J.vandenHorn@fibre.a2000.nl>
    - GDI32: Fixed bug in font.cpp
             iFontRename should use strncpy instead of memcpy since source
             string passed may be smaller than amount of bytes to copy
             resulting in GPF.

 2000-05-14: Przemyslaw Dobrowolski <dobrawka@asua.org.pl>
    - WNASPI32: Implemented working ASPI.

 2000-05-14: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>

 2000-05-12: Edgar Buerkle <Edgar.Buerkle@gmx.net>
    - KERNEL32: Print name of image referenced by EIP (stackdump)

 2000-05-12: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   Fixed bug in HOOK_RemoveHook (wrong call for enter semaphore method)
                SetSysColors bugfix (called itself for some reason)
                Fixed wrong dispatch of messages under certain conditions
    - COMDLG32: Fixed initial directory for GetOpen/SaveFileNameW
                If initial dir string == "" -> use current dir (not only
                when ptr equals NULL) (verified this behaviour in NT 4)
    - GDI32:    Do manual image flip in dib section blit (fixes wrong position
                of Palm Emulator bitmap)
                Might also fix reversed video in RealPlayer 7 (Warp 4 FP13/WSeB FP1)

 2000-05-10: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
    - COMCTL32: Fixed treeview item height bug (reported by Markus Montkowski)

 2000-05-10: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   Fix for SetForegroundWindow (SWP_NOZORDER flag removed)
                GetForegroundWindow now uses WinQueryActiveWindow instead
                of Open32's GetForegroundWindow
    - KERNEL32: Extra logging for atom functions, fixed GlobalGetAtomNameW
    - COMDLG32: Added missing ascii to unicode conversions in GetFileDialog95W
                (file name (returned), initial dir & file dialog title)
    - RICHED32: Added (Wine port)
    - TOOLS\INSTALL: Added ChangeLog to installation script

 2000-05-09: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: Enclose executable name in quotes if it (or it's directory)
                contains spaces
                Route rtl error messages to logfile (_set_crt_msg_handle)
                Added support for system, user default & neutral language in
                FindResourceExA/W
                Fill in correct language id in GetUserDefaultLCID/GetSystemDefaultLCID
                GetUserDefaultLangID & GetSystemDefaultLangID; gets country
                with DosQueryCtryInfo
    - WSOCK32:  Return WSAWOULDBLOCK if recv returns 0 and connection is
                still available. (experimental change for rp7)
    - USER32:   MENU_PtMenu: return when menu has no window handle (prevents
                Moraff's YourJongg from crashing -> need to check why this
                happens)
                Bugfix in AdjustWindowRectEx; if style, exstyle and menu
                = 0 -> no changes required to the input rectangle
                (verified this in NT 4)
                Don't send WM_ACTIVATE, WM_SET/KILLFOCUS & WM_SHOWWINDOW
                messages when window is being destroyed.
    - SHELL32:  Wrong systray classname used when creating systray window
                Fixed bugs in SYSTRAY_SetTip/SYSTRAY_ModifyTip; string
                copy operations used wrong size -> heap corruption
    - DINPUT:   Check window handle if app acquired mouse input in
                cooperative mode
    - TOOLS\INSTALL: Fixed wrong glide dll for voodoo 2 install package

 2000-05-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - GDI32:    Added stretch blit mode support to dibsection blits

 2000-05-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   Fixed window property functions (ported from Wine)
                The old ones used Open32 functions which no longer work
                due to atom api changes a few months ago.
                If the mouse has already been captured, then it must
                be released before calling WinSetCapture ->
                fixes menus & dialog in MS Word 97
    - OLE32:    Fixed BindCtxImpl_SetBindOptions/BindCtxImpl_GetBindOptions
                Need to check size of bind structure before copying (as done in Wine)
                -> fixes crash (stack corruption) in MS Word 97
    - WSOCK32:  When changing the receive or send buffer (setsockopt) and
                it fails with WSAENOBUFS, decrease size until no error
                is returned (63kb buffer is not always accepted by the
                16 bits tcpip stack) (stops when buffer < 4096)

 2000-05-04: Achim Hasenmueller <achimha@innotek.de>
    - USER32:   Applied fix to GetDCEx where the check to see if
                the window has its own DC was applying invalid
                style flags due to missing parantheses
                (reported by Oliver Braun)

 2000-05-04: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   Menu font from bold to normal again. Bold fonts are too
                big (rp7 menu split in two parts).

 2000-05-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - WSOCK32:  Fixed WSAEFAULT errors in setsockopt (16 bits TCP/IP stack
                doesn't like high addresses; similar problems can also occur
                elsewhere in wsock32)
    - USER32:   Change settings return by SystemParameterInfo for SPI_GETNONCLIENTMETRICS
                Caption & menu fonts now bold; different sizes (more like Wine now)
                Set/clear WS_VISIBLE flag in SetWindowPos; don't call
                ShowWindow.
                Implemented Set/Get/ReleaseCapture without Open32
                Release capture for window that is about to be disabled
                Send WM_CAPTURECHANGED messages when capture changes

 2000-05-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: GetLocaleInfoA/W fix (size of buffer for i.e. LOCALE_IDATE
                should be >= 2, not > 2)
                VirtualFree: Check for ERROR_ALIAS return value

                Ported and changed/fixed XFolder stack dump code (symbol file only)
                When a win32 app crashes, a dump of the stack is written
                in odin32_0.log.
    - USER32:   Merged some Wine dialog changes (setting focus + font size)
                Extra logging for some apis
                Added support for RDW_FRAME flag to GetDCEx
    - INCLUDE\makefiles:
                Added rule for converting map to symfile
                A symbol file is now created for each exe/dll
    - INCLUDE\ODINWRAP:
                Turned off profiling by default.
                Our log is big enough as it is without even
                more logging.

 2000-05-02: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - makefile and tools/makefile:
                tools/install is not a "needed tool" required for
                to do the rest of the build; and it'is dependent on
                kernel32.lib which haven't been made at the time
                the needed_tools are being made. So, the making of
                tools/install is the last thing we do in the makeprocess.
    - WSOCK32, WINMM:
                ODINWRAP changes below broke WSOCK32 and WINMM.
                I've created some highly temporary fix for it this problem.
                Could someone please make a permanent fix?
    - tools/bin/wrc.exe and tools/wrc:
                Important notice: __WIN32OS2__ is not defined when making wrc!
                This was the reason why ':' was used as include separator.
                This is corrected now. ';' is now the include separator.
                A new wrc.exe has been checked in.
