    - WINMM:    o Default waveout volume can be controlled by a key in odin.ini:
                  [WINMM]
                  DefVolume=50[0-100] Default waveout volume (default = 100)

    - USER32:   o Send WM_HELP if F1 pressed & no menu active
                o Disabled system hooks (only work in one process)
    - KERNEL32: o Improved ordinal lookup a bit. (usually 4 times faster, but
                  barely noticable with 'real' applications)
    - OLE32:    o Added OleLoadPictureEx stub
    - GDI32:    o GetDIBits fix for querying the bitmap information
                  WGSS returns 0, but we should return the nr of scan lines requested
                o GetDIBits fix for memory dcs. WGSS messes things up if
                  it's a memory DC.
                  (fixes lower right button in AIM's logon window when typing
                   in new name)
                o ExtTextOutA/W fix for filling rectangle with background color
                  only. This doesn't seem to work (anymore) with GpiCharStringPosAt.
                  (fixes border between menu & button bar in Odin MFC app &
                   Acrobat Reader 4.05)
                o StretchDIBits fix for RGB555 bitmaps 
                  (fixes pictures in pdf files shown by Acrobat Reader 4.05)
    - SHLWAPI:  o Added PathGetCharTypeA/W from Wine

    - KERNEL32: o benchmarked new experimental loader and reverted to
                  old but slightly optimized loader (processExport usually
                  outweighs processImport, so lookup is less valuable than
                  add to export list)
    - SHELL32:  o SIC_Initialize took extremely long to pre-initialize 
                  its icon cache. Revert to on-demand loading of the icons,
                  speeds up loading of SHELL32 (therefore most apps) 
                  by several seconds.
