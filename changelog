 2002-09-04: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin   >
    - FASTDEP:  o Corrected bug in caching. Didn't force rescan of files when
                  a dependant file wasn't present any more.
                o Corrected makefile. No memory debug.
    - CMDQD:    o Corrected makefile.

    - Tools/DailyBuilds:
                o Changed odin32env.cmd to use buildenv.cmd to set up the
                  desired build environment.
                o Changed odin32clean.cmd to use tools\bin\rm.exe.
    - MAKE:     o Corrected CC_NO_DBGMEM check for vac3xx.

    - USER32:   o Fix for Ctrl-Break

 2002-08-29: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin   >
    - COMMON:   o Implemented parsing of the SEGMENTS in a definition file
                  (class kFileDef), in order to produce better watcom linker
                  directives.

 2002-08-28: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - DDRAW:    o Added custom function to hide mouse cursor when the primary
                  surface (screen) is locked by the app to prevent display
                  corruption with color/animated mouse pointers.

 2002-08-27: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin   >
    - FASTDEP:  o Tweaked cyclic dependency checks performance a little bit more.
    - MAKE      o Splitted out linker and library configs into separat config
                  files. Both to have less files to update, and to be able to
                  easer choose linker or archiver.
                o Tried to make ilink and optional linker for watcom, but
                  it produces bad executable files. Will fix this later.

 2002-08-27: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >

 2002-08-27: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >

                o Fixed the 16 bits mess (incorrect handle conversion)

 2002-08-23: Yuri Dario <mc6530@mclink   >
    - TOOLS:    o VAC40 filter fixes for mapsym.cmd.

 2002-08-23: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin   >
    - TOOLS:    o Made mapsym.cmd quiet on 4os2 too.
                o Made BldLevelInf.cmd respecting BUILD_VERBOSE and BUILD_QUIET;
                  and fixed an old typo.
                o Update the Do* and BldLevelInf.cmd with novalue signalhandlers.
                  (Something all rexx script should use!)
    - MAKE:     o Completed Odin32 config.
                o Default target is DLL, but if CUSTOMBUILD defined LIB.
    - ADVAPI32, ODINCRT:
                o Made makefiles support the new build system.
                  (Using the new if BUILD_SETUP_MAK is defined.)

 2002-08-23: Herwig Bauernfeind <herwig.bauernfeind@aon   >
    - TOOLS\ODINBUG, DOC, BIN
                o OdinBug update

 2002-08-23: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Ugly hack added to work around crash in PM when child window
                  calls DestroyWindow for parent or owner in WM_DESTROY handler
                  (solution: postpone DestroyWindow for parent/owner)

 2002-08-23: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin   >
    - TOOLS:    o Added a rm.exe binary from the OS2Tools tree.
                  The new build system uses this. Then clean will
                  work everywhere!

 2002-08-22: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - SHELL32:  o Added bugfix to IEnumIDList_Folder_Constructor (from Wine)

 2002-08-21: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin   >
    - MAKE:     o Implemented a 'needed' pass to make required tools (for
                  instance code generators).
                o Made SUBDIRS and PRE/POSTMAKEFILES more customizable by
                  adding support for override macros:
                     [SUBDIRS|[PRE|POST]MAKEFILES]_<mainrule>
                  This is good when you wanna skip a tree for a rule (=pass)
                  or/and just run do a rule (=pass) in a specific tree.
                o Added check for TARGET_PRIVATE macro before installing
                  anything.
    - CMDQD, FASTDEP:
                o Made makefiles support the new build system.
                  (Using the new if BUILD_SETUP_MAK is defined.)

                o Quick LIB testcases.

 2002-08-20: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >

 2002-08-19: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Don't send queued WM_CHAR messages for windows that have
                  just been destroyed. (Get/PeekMessage)

 2002-08-17: Yuri Dario <mc6530@mclink   >

    - WINMM:    o Put back old wave playback resume code
    - DINPUT:   o Merged with latest Wine (DirectInput 8 support)
                o Added bugfix from June 18th:
                  SysMouseAImpl_GetDeviceData: check if internal dinput
                  mouse state is out of sync and update if necessary
    - USER32:   o SetCursorPos change:
                  The current cursor position may not have been passed to the application
                  just yet. The position change discards any previous events which may
                  lead to inconsistent mouse behaviour (like in DirectInput).
                  To fix this, we pass down a mouse move event to any hook handlers.

                o Enable owner of window destroyed by DestroyWindow. Disabled

 2002-08-12: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - COMCTL32: o Tooltips: ignore TTS_ALWAYSTIP style. Windows 2000 appears

                  letter.
    - OLE32:    o Disabled mouse cursor changes in drag 'n drop code.
                  (causes mouse cursor changes when clicking on item in
                   file open dialog)
