    - Pe2Lx:    o Convert CUI subsystem to VIO apps. CUI applications will
                  now work as executed thru pec.exe.
    - Kernel32: o Init VIO Console for Pe2Lx CUI images.

    - DDRAW:    o Finally merged DDRAW and DDRAW\NEW. A new key in ODIN.INI
                  controls which version to use:

                  [DirectDraw]
                  Fullscreen=[True|False|0|1]

                  Don't blame me if your machine goes up in smoke after you've
                  turned fullscreen on ;-)
                  Note: It seems that fullscreen currently doesn't work right
                  with newer SDD releases for 8bpp apps, though 16/24/32bpp
                  should be OK (palette setting problems)

    - tools/fastdep:
                o Ported to NT by faking the necessary OS/2 APIs.
