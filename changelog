    - USER32:   o If a static window has children, then we can't return HTTRANSPARENT
                  for WM_NCHITTEST. For some reason PM then sends all mouse messages 
                  to the parent of the static window; even if they are intended 
                  for the children of the static window.
                  TODO: This could break some win32 apps (parent not receiving mouse
                        message for static window (non-child) area)
                        Rewrite NCHITTEST handling. (don't use PM)
                  (fixes Roger Wilco config window input)
                o Call GlobalAddAtomA/W in RegisterWindowMessageA/W
                  (don't use Open32)

 2001-03-24: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - WINMM:    o mmsystemGetVersion returned wrong version. Should be 0x030A.
                  (returned in NT4, SP6)
                o Ported Wine's PlaySoundA/W, sndPlaySoundA/W
                o Enabled DirectAudio interface code for wave playback
                  (available in upcoming SB Live driver version 0.70)
                  (works well with WinAmp 2.72)
    - USER32:   o GetAsyncKeyState implemented (calls Open32)

 2001-03-23: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - WINMM:    o Wrong calling convention for timer thread handler (os2timer.cpp)
                o Preliminary code for DirectAudio wave playback (new audio
                  interface in the upcoming SB Live driver)
                o Rewrote DART wave playback & recording classes
                o Added support for more callback types (event, thread)
                o Fixed wrong callback parameter (window callback) for waveIn/OutReset
                  Note: Untested code. Will be tested & fixed tomorrow.

 2001-03-22: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Ported Wine's GetBinaryTypeA/W
                o Wrote assembly wrapper for thread handler calling to cope with
                  buggy applications that use the wrong calling convention for
                  thread handlers. (like @#$@#% PowerDVD)
                  (fixes crash in PowerDVD with release build of kernel32)

 2001-03-22: Michal Necasek <michalnec@volny.cz>
    - USER32:   o Show the mouse pointer in the exitlist handler of user32.
                  (should restore the mouse pointer after a game crashes)

 2001-03-21: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Added support for disabling logging for a specific thread
    - WINMM:    o Pause playback after underrun & restart it properly when
                  new buffers arrive.

 2001-03-20: Michal Necasek <michalnec@volny.cz>
    - include/DDRAW:
                o Cleaned up so that it builds with Watcom. Still lots
                  of warnings and Watcom build doesn't seem to work right now.

    - Odin32Api:
                o Added sample makefile (from the Generic SDK sample)
                   (Just remeber to rename the generic.rc to resource.orc.)

 2001-03-20: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - DPLAYX:   o Fix for nameless unions & VAC 3.6.5 (makefile)

 2001-03-19: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Fail properly when dll can't be found (pe loader)
    - WINMM:    o Do not pause wave stream after underrun. Stop it instead.
                  (writing audio buffers to a paused stream crashes MMPM2)
                  (fixes crash while playing movie in PowerDVD)
                o Added level 2 logging support.
                o Recording callback bugfix
                o Several playback changes & fixes
                o Do not use TIB selector of thread that issues waveOut/InOpen.
                  Instead query selector of main thread in DART callback thread.
                  (fixes crash in WinAmp when pressing stop; thread that opened
                   the playback stream is terminated before the stream is stopped)
    - GDI32:    o Check y inversion when resyncing dib section


 2001-03-19: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Pe2Lx:    o Convert CUI subsystem to VIO apps. CUI applications will
                  now work as executed thru pec.exe.
    - Kernel32: o Init VIO Console for Pe2Lx CUI images.

                  [DirectDraw]
                  Fullscreen=[True|False|0|1]

                  Don't blame me if your machine goes up in smoke after you've
                  turned fullscreen on ;-)
                  Note: It seems that fullscreen currently doesn't work right
                  with newer SDD releases for 8bpp apps, though 16/24/32bpp
                  should be OK (palette setting problems)

    - tools/dailbuild:
                o Added jade and DocBook to the environment.
    - include/win32k.h:
                o Defines OBJ_ANY on demand. (For use with DosAllocMemEx().)
    - tools/fastdep:
                o Ported to NT by faking the necessary OS/2 APIs.
                  Tested with Watcom C/C++ v11.0.
                  Makefile target: fastdepnt.exe

                  (fixes background in CDRLabel)

 2001-03-13: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Removed include <builtin.h> from several files. (no longer necessary)

                o Dll entrypoint changes for Watcom
    - USER32:   o Set last error to ERROR_INVALID_WINDOW_HANDLE if application
                  passes invalid window handle to BeginPaint.
                  (verified in NT4, SP6)

 2001-03-12: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Fix for SearchPathA with NULL parameter for output buffer
                  (reported by Ahti Heinla)
    - USER32:   o Fail if BeginPaint is called with NULL PAINTSTRUCT pointer
                  (verified in NT4, SP6)

                o Removed #ifdef IBMCPP statements (moved into initdll.h).

 2001-03-11: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k, Pe2Lx, Elf2Lx, Xx2Lx:
                o Made generic Xx2Lx util for both Pe2Lx and Elf2Lx
                  (and any future loaders).
                  Pe2Lx.exe is now named Xx2Lx.exe!
                o Makefile fixes.
                o Elf2Lx compiles (non-working dummy).
                o Fixed vprint and vprintf16 to not skip multiple LF/CRs.
