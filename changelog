    - KERNEL32: o WaitForSingleObject, (Msg)WaitForMultipleObjects:
                  If dwTimeout is not 0 and smaller than 20 ms, then
                  temporarily change thread priority to time critical to
                  make sure we don't get a late timeout.
                  (CLOCKSCALE=4 in config.sys also improves timeout responds)

    - MAKE:     o Corrected bug in process which made it put the libraries in
                  the wrong place.
                o Always stamp the .def file before linking so that build level
                  info will be up to date.
                o Added some shortcuts rules for lazy programmers:
                  * pass[1-6] for starting from a given pass.
                  * quick for only doing lib, executable and publish.
