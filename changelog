    - WINMM:    o Allocate handle for new timer and verify handle
                  is valid before using it. 
                  (prevents crashes when app attempts to delete timer twice
                   (DivX 4))
    - DDRAW:    o Fixed memory leaks in SurfBlt4 (rectangles)
                o Take clipping into account in SurfBlt4. Windowed DirectDraw
                  blitting now seems to work well. 
                  (only tried DivX 4; needs more testing)
    - USER32:   o Rewrote sizing & moving of windows (frame tracking)
                  (ported Wine version + fixed some bugs)
                  Some applications (e.g. RealPlayer) resize themselves
                  when receiving WM_SIZING msgs. Not possible to send those
                  with PM's frame tracking.
                  TODO: fix flickering of size border (dynamic drag off)
                  TODO: WM_SIZING handling not 100% correct yet
                  TODO: Must display size/move cursor when starting action
                        from system menu
                o GetDCEx change; always call WinGetClipPS (!CS_OWNDC)

    - REGSVR32: o Must use LoadLibrary, not CoLoadLibrary
                  (Some dlls (divx codec) call CoFreeUnusedLibraries which 
                   unloads the same dll if we use CoLoadLibrary (-> crash)
                   NT's regsvr32 doesn't use CoLoadLibrary either)
    - USER32:   o OSLibWinGetMsg bugfix

 2001-10-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Lastest Wine revision of GetNextDlgGroupItem ported + modified
