    - tools/install:Added a stram 'close' on the changelog.
                    (4OS2 can't copy files which are opened for write(?).
                    The changelog has to be closed after copying it into
                    the odininst.wis file.)

                    Creates .WPI releases too.

                    WarpIn is added to the build environment variables
                    (odin32env.cmd).

    - USER32:       Fixed wrong dispatch of WM_NCHITTEST
                    Fixed DC leak in EndPaint (reset hps type to TYPE_1)
                    -> resulted in out of memory and very slow PM operations
                    -> ICQ 2000a install now finishes (used to run out of mem)
                    Rewrote window management; now one PM window (non-frame)
                    is created for each win32 window (used to be a frame/client
                    pair)
                    -> speeds up drawing & fixes some repaint problems
                    Window coordinates (internally stored) are now relative
                    to window parent (or screen coord. if no parent); client
                    coordinates relative to the frame window
                    GetParent now returns owner if toplevel window
                    SetParent hides and shows window when changing parent
                    Added support for DCX_USESTYLE, DCX_CLIPSIBLINGS, DCX_CLIPCHILDREN
                    and DCX_PARENTCLIP in GetDCEx

                          changes
                    SetParent/GetParent fixes for desktop parent.
    - SHELL32:      Disabled system tray window for now. (appears in top/right
                    of the desktop otherwise)

 2000-06-03: Jeroen van den Horn <J.vandenHorn@fibre.a2000.nl>
    - WINMM:        Don't start playback when WaveOutRestart is called
                    before any buffers have been added.
                    Clear WHDR_INQUEUE bit for buffers returned in WaveOutReset

 2000-06-03: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k/REXX:  Rewrote the REXX stub program in assembly.
                    (exe size: 688 bytes) Might be able to embedd it in
                    win32k.sys... (not priority)

 2000-06-02: Jeroen van den Horn <J.vandenHorn@fibre.a2000.nl>

    - KERNEL32:     Rewrote CompareFileTime, DeleteFileA
                    Put file io apis in separate handlemanager object class
                    Rewrote most file io apis; includes support for 64 bits file
                    pointer/size:
                    - CreateFile/OpenFile/DuplicateHandle/CloseHandle
                    - ReadFile(Ex)/WriteFileEx/GetFileType/GetFileInformationByHandle
                    - SetEndOfFile/SetFileTime/GetFileTime/GetFileSize
                    - SetFilePointer/LockFile(Ex)/UnlockFile(Ex)/FlushFileBuffers
                    Fixed some OpenFile bugs. Put Read/WriteFileEx into file
                    io class. Fixed LockFileEx/UnlockFileEx
                    New file apis use OS/2 apis now; overlapped IO not yet
                    supported.
