- GetBitmapDimensionEx returns (0,0) for icon bitmaps (TODO)
- Open32 returns double height of icon masks (correct for OS/2, but
  not for color win32 icon color bitmaps!) ('workaround' present)

- AH: Registry entires have trailing newline character 0xA. Could
      be a bug in the registry write code

- AH: Syscolors are not matched correctly, OS/2 does not take the
      exact RGB color but rather something "similar"

- CB: GDI32 coding rules:
  - Don't call functions which record metafiles inside GDI32
    Use OSLibGpi* functions or create a new function called Odin* which
    doesn't add metafile data

- DosSetFileLocksL:
  an offset with anything other than 0 in the top dword will only work 
  on IFSes that support 64 bit access. For now, that's just JFS. Thus, 
  your observation that this works on JFS and fails on HPFS is what 
  we'd expect.
