Reporting Odin bugs
-------------------

To make our job easier when dealing with reports of failures to run 
certain apps, there's a standard form to report bug. (see below)

Some remarks:
        - unless the debug version of Odin works ok, always try the debug build 
          with the application
        - make sure you have installed Odin properly (WarpIN)
        - pe.exe is the recommended way to run windows applications; remove
          win32k from your config.sys (note that WarpIN does *not* install win32k)
        - use a recent daily build. Bug reports with ancient (> 1 week old) builds
          are not very useful. the problem you report might no longer be present
        - always send these bug reports to the odinusers mailinglist; not directly 
          to the developers.
          (so others can respond if the problem is old or already fixed)
          (odinusers@egroups.com; go to www.egroups.com to subscribe)

Sometimes the small part of the logfile isn't enough for us to determine 
where the problem lies.
In that case, we'll ask you to mail us the entire file. (zipped)
So please *do not* send big logfiles to the mailinglist!

Generating useful logfiles
--------------------------
To enable logging in the debug build, add the following environment variable:
	SET WIN32LOG_ENABLED=1

This turns on logging for all debug dlls.
However, this can result in huge logfiles. To reduce the size, use release
builds of dlls that are not relevant to the problem you're seeing.
The general rule is that usually only the logging information generated by
gdi32, kernel32 and user32 is important.
Use the release build of gdi32 if the problem you're seeing isn't related
to painting. (gdi32 generates a *lot* of logging information)

Logging.txt contains information on how to selectively enable/disable logging.
Doing this requires some knowledge about the layout of the Odin source tree 
and what each source file does.


Useful tips
-----------
Crashes are always easy to locate in logfiles (search for 'Exception Information'), 
but improper behaviour isn't.
In the system menu (top left button of a window), there's a menu item called
'Put mark in debug log'. Selecting this item puts the line 'Mark requested 
by user' in the log. 
This can be useful i.e. if a window is resized improperly after you click
on a button. To make it easy for us to locate the right log lines, you
should select the 'Put mark in debug log' menu item and then click on the
button that causes the problem.
