To Do list for ODIN:


Assigned Status Topic -------------------------------------------------------

PD       DONE   Handle named pipes via HandleManager

AH              Do COM (serial port) support for ODIN (requires
                pseudo-device in HM)

PH              Sync SHELL32 with WINE

PH              Sync NTDLL with WINE

JW              Put in correct FS:-wrappers in CRTDLL and MSVCRT

JW              Improve CRTDLL and MSVCRT as this is one major show stopper 
                currently

SvL             Remove GPI32 calls from the original FS: macros and replace
                them with ODINFUNCTION wrappers. Internally call to ODIN_xxx
                GPI functions to get much better performance.

NOONE           KERNEL32: Build fake PE headers for odin dlls (dll handle must be pointer to header)
                          (some applications use the handles as pointers)

NOONE           USER32: Fix LoadImage to resize icons, cursors or bitmaps
                        to the specified dimensions (if required)

NOONE           WINMM: wave recording

NOONE           WINMM: Rewrite winmm to use driver architecture (port Wine's winmm
                       + integrate current Odin code)

NOONE           WINMM: Fix and finish MIDI in/out (using RTMIDI)

NOONE	        KERNEL32: Async file io

NOONE           KERNEL32: Vio support for console applications

NOONE           WSOCK32: Winsock 2 implementation

NOONE           GDI32: Rewrite using Gpi api (remove Open32 dependancy)

NOONE           Setup a test /verification plan and freeze some modules such
                as LZ32, VERSION which are considered complete.
                Also ensure the source code is well documented and structured.
