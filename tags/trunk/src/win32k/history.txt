    - Uses root changelog.

 1999-09-08: KSO
    - Initial checkin of code into CVS for Odin32.
    - Don't work!!!
    - Pe2Lx source is not in sync!
    - Rewrote skelton. (partly tested)
    - New heap.
	- Win32k will now only work if a correct .sym-file and a kernel-file is
	  found. Initiation code is therefore changed.
	- Changed device-line parameters to take .sym-file and kernel-file names.
	  Removed obsolute options.
	- Changed the way procedure addresses are calculated to support warpserver
	  for e-business. (Warp v4.5). (not tested!)

	- All LX* classes is documented briefly.
	- Get*SectionByAddress() have changed names and more strict use,
	  eliminating missunderstanding and potential bugs. New functions are and
	  should be named after the following standard:
	    Get*SectionIdx* - Gets the index into PESection for a section
	    Get*ObjectNo*   - Gets the 1 based object number for an object.
	- GetAddressPage is renamed to GetPageByVA
	- /L option is changed: /L turns on logging, if not present no logging.
	- Exports may be present in .EXEs and .DLLs my have no exports.
	- TIBFixObject (or call it TIBFixSection depending on context) TIBFix is
	  put into an Object of its own. Currently it is placed at 0x10000 for
	  .EXEs and at the end of .DLLs. I just think I found a never occuring
	  problem: PE file with base at 0x10000, will put TIBFixObject last
	  may fail if stack is grown. This is a problem only present with old
	  WinNT 3.1-3.50(?) .EXEs. (But I'll fix it later some time.)
	- SetEntryAddress may happen to work - but is currently unused.


 98-08-09: KSO
 	- Documneting started. Currently using SDS styled documentation.
 	  SDS was made of a friend of mine. It may generate HTML docs based on
 	  the .cpp and .h files. My parts (win32k, kMMF) is documented this way.
	- Resources are now mostly rewritten to support the new resource handling
	  of win32k - which I am working at. All resources have a Show<rsrc>, a
	  Convert<rsrc> and a QuerySize<rsrc> call.
	  TODO: Cursors and icons are not yet finished. Requires: thinking...
	- Copyright info from win32k are updated to include PE2LX and MWDD32.
	- Borland fixes... Most from Borland and Watcom should now convert.
	- else see changlog for whole project (PE2LX).

 98-07-05: KSO - created history
	- ProbeKernel - automatic detector of kernel and finder of procedures
	- most pointers should now been assert
	- itoa should not be used - it assumes ss == ds - use sprintf
	- option /L works
