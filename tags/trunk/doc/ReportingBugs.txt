Reporting Odin bugs
-------------------

To make our job easier when dealing with reports of failures to run 
certain apps, there's a standard form to report bug. (see below)

Some remarks:
        - unless the debug version of Odin works ok, always try the debug build 
          with the application
        - make sure you have installed Odin properly (WarpIN)
        - pe.exe is the recommended way to run windows applications; remove
          win32k from your config.sys (note that WarpIN does *not* install win32k)
        - use a recent daily build. Bug reports with ancient (> 1 week old) builds
          are not very useful. the problem you report might no longer be present
        - always send these bug reports to the odinusers mailinglist; not directly 
          to the developers.
          (so others can respond if the problem is old or already fixed)
          (odinusers@egroups.com; go to www.egroups.com to subscribe)

Sometimes the small part of the logfile isn't enough for us to determine 
where the problem lies.
In that case, we'll ask you to mail us the entire file. (zipped)
So please *do not* send huge logfiles to this list!
