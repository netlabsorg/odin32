 2001-02-29: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o First check executable name during internal dll loading
                  then try loading it as a dll.
                o Reroute ReadFile for standard handle class to Open32.

 2001-02-28: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Added support for high memory override key in odin.ini:
                  [ODINSYSTEM]
                  HIGHMEM=0
                  Turns off high memory usage in Odin. Useful for Warp 4 (>fp12)
                  systems that still use the old 16 bits TCPIP stack.
                  (temporary workaround)
                  NOTE: Turning this option off will prevent Odin from running
                        applications that must be loaded in high memory
                        (like MS Word).
    - NTDLL:    o Committed update from Jan. 25th:
                  Ported latest NtQuerySystemInformation from Wine
                  (includes fix for IE5 install)
    - include\odinwrap.h:
                o Wrappers only detect FS problems when they should correct them.
                  (fixes FS corruption in wsock32 (WSAStartup/WSACleanup))

 2001-02-27: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - WINMM:    o Added recording (still untested)
                o waveOutReset bugfix
                o Compile fix (midi.cpp)
    - USER32:   o Ported latest wsprintf Wine functions (not much changed; only
                  to stay in sync)

 2001-02-26: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - WINMM:    o Fixed FS corruption in RTMidi class (wrappers for RTMIDI
                  functions)

 2001-02-25: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Check executable too when searching for imported modules
                  (directly imported by PE dlls)

 2001-02-24: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Set fExitProcess flag in WinExe destructor to prevent reloading
                  dlls after loading of exe failed.

 2001-02-23: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - GDI32:    o Removed old workaround for SetDIBitsToDevice. Incorrect for
                  new implementation of this function with StretchDIBits.
                  (fixes bitmaps in Minesweeper)
    - USER32:   o WM_SETCURSOR change; don't check WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY style
                  when sending this message to the parent of a child window.
                o Redraw entire window when switching between minimized, maximized
                  and restored windows state.
                o Added missing cursor to MDI client class
                  (cursor now changes when moving cursor from mdi child to
                   client window)
    - USER32, include\win\drive.h:
                o DRIVE_GetDosCwd bugfix
                  (fixes crash in Cool Edit old-style file open dialog)

 2000-02-22: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   o Support for the 14062e kernels.
                o Removed the CALLTAB segment.
                o Hooked dh_SendEvent and RASRST for taskmanager hot-key support.
                o Enabled callgate on SMP kernel.

 2001-02-22: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Changed error string when detecting version mismatch.
    - USER32:   o Fixed incorrect index checking for class and window words.
                o Allow misaligned access to window words/longs
                  (fixes crash in Quicken 99)
                o More minimize changes/fixes for MDI windows.
                o Update region fix in NotifyFrameChanged method

 2001-02-21: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Changes for minimizing windows. Not done yet.
                o Added CreateFakeWindowEx.
                  Turns native OS/2 window into window recognized by Odin (with
                  only very limited functionality)
                  Useful for creating an Odin window with an OS/2 window as
                  parent.

                  Applications don't expect WM_NULL when fetching mouse
                  messages from the queue.
                  (fixes mouse jumping in Unreal)

 2000-02-20: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   o Moved calltabs to the code segments. Clears the
                  WriteProtect(WP) flag in CR0 to be able to do this. The flags
                  is of course restored when the calltabs are written.
                o Completed callgate code. Though is not activated for SMP
                  kernels yet as I haven't tested that yet.
                  The callgate works just as any other callgate in OS2, it
                  calls kernel routines for entry and exit housekeeping.
                o Updated the win32k library and header to accomodate this.
                  All IOCtl structures are changed.
                  So, Install the new the new Odin32 and reboot before using
                  it so the new win32k.sys is installed.

 2001-02-20: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Fix for position of system menu in (mdi) child windows
                o Use WinScrollWindow to scroll children again and manually
                  notify children that they have moved. (PM only does this
                  for windows with CS_MOVENOTIFY class)
                  (much smoother scroll in Opera)
                o Use WinGetMaxPosition to determine default maximized position
                  of toplevel window before sending WM_GETMINMAXINFO
                  (maximized Odin windows no longer obscure WarpCenter)
                o Activation fixes for MDI windows

 2000-02-19: Oliver Braun <Oliver.Braun@hamburg.de>
    - KERNEL32: o OSLibDosAllocMem fix (better checks for errors + return
                  4kb aligned memory if 64kb alignment fails)
                  (fixes StarOffice 5.2 install)

 2000-02-19: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - KERNEL32: o Use DosAllocMemEx to 64KB align memory (OSLibDosAllocMem)
                  when available.
    - Win32k:   o Prepared API code for both callgate and IOCtl invokation.
                  This caused changes in IOCtl parameter structures.
                  Callgate code is completed but not used yet because
                  it isn't tested yet.

 2001-02-19: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - COMDLG32: o Commented out Norse ChooseFont dialog (incomplete translation)
                  Use the English version instead.
    - USER32:   o Corrected invalidating nonclient parts of a window after a resize.
                  (fixes resizing of mdi windows in mdi sample)

 2000-02-18: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   o Finished implementation of DosAllocMemEx.
                  DosAllocMemEx is equal to DosAllocMem but takes some extra
                  OBJ_ flags (defined in win32k.h).
                  TODO: "Grow arena" problem when allocating memory at a
                  specific location. I'll fix this ASAP and add a fix for the
                  loader too (which has the same problems with loading EXEs
                  without fixup above 64MB).

 2001-02-18: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Restore window origin in SetWindowPos for parent window with
                  CS_OWNDC style.
                  Do the same thing in WM_VRNENABLED message handler.
                  (fixes paint offset problems in Opera windows)
                o Bug in yesterday's ScrollWindowEx fix
                  (fixes smooth scrolling of child windows in Opera html window)
                o Detect DestroyWindow call during CreateWindowEx and delay
                  deleting the window/dialog object.
                  (fixes crash in Opera when going to fullscreen mode)

 2000-02-17: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32kCC: o Rewrote to notebook. (fixes size problem)
                o Added memoryinfo page which is refreshed every second.

 2000-02-17: Yuri Dario <mc6530@mclink.it>
    - INCLUDE:  o Header changes for compiling Opera

 2001-02-17: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Store active status in custom window word. QWS_FLAGS appears
                  to be modified by PM somewhere.
                  (fixes WM_ACTIVATE loop in Opera when maximizing or restoring
                   the mdi window)
                o Don't include RDW_NOERASE flag in InvalidateRect/Rgn
                  (fixes background erase for mdi client window in Opera)
                o IsChild only checked the direct parent of a window. Must
                  check all parents (parents of parents etc)
                  (fixes TAB handling in Opera dialogs)
                o Ported latest GetNextDlgTabItem from Wine
                  (fixes TAB handling in Opera dialogs)
                o WM_ADJUSTWINDOWPOS bugfix (if app changes size/position)
                  OSLibMapWINDOWPOStoSWP can add flags, but we must not let
                  it remove flags.
                  (fixes resizing of Opera MDI windows)
                o ScrollWindow(Ex) bugfixes
                  Must scroll child windows manually
                  (fixes scrolling of Opera html MDI windows)
                o Combobox fix from Wine (CBCalcPlacement)
                  (fixes combobox controls in Opera html MDI windows)
                  (TODO: sync rest with latest Wine control code)

 2001-02-15: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - COMDLG32: o Ignore OFN_FILEMUSTEXIST flag in GetSaveFileNameA/W
                  (NT4 seems to ignore it too and it fixes the save dialog
                   in ElstarFormular 2000)

 2001-02-14: knut stange osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k.lib:
                o Corrected build breaker: log.h should not be included.
                  log.h was removed from the CINLCUDES two days ago.

 2001-02-14: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Allocate TLS index of module before loading the dll it needs
                  (some apps assume their executable index is always zero)
                  (fixes crash in BrMSX)
                o Must use EXC_CallHandler to call RtlUnwind handler
                  (fixes crash during RaiseException in BrMSX)
    - OPENGL\GLU:
                o Removed initterm.cpp. Use dllentry.obj instead
    - INCLUDE\misc.h:
                o Print file and function name before executing an int 3. (DebugInt3)
    - *\initterm.cpp:
                o Wrong calling convention for CRT_Init/Term, ctordtorInit/Term
                o VAC 3.6.5 ctordtorInit/Term takes one parameter
    - USER32:   o Delay SetFocus when called during processing of WM_SETFOCUS
                  message (not allowed by PM).
                  (fixes keyboard focus in ElstarFormular 2000)

 2000-02-13: Michal Necasek <michalnec@volny.cz>
    - USER32:   o Wrong unicode<->ascii translation for some listbox & combobox
                  messages. Must check if the control style includes LB/CB_HASSTRINGS.
                  (CB_FINDSTRING, CB_FINDSTRINGEXACT, CB_SELECTSTRING,
                   LB_FINDSTRING, LB_FINDSTRINGEXACT, LB_SELECTSTRING)

 2001-02-12: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k.lib:
                o Removed /src/win32k/include from the CFLAGS.

 2001-02-11: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   o Added symbols for the 14062D kernels.
                o Added a query API for getting memory information.
                o Added force preload option - should be very useful when
                  debugging Ring 3 apps with ICAT. (Option -F)

 2001-02-11: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - ODINCRT:  o Completed runtime dll for VAC 3.6.5
    - WINMM, GLU, CRTDLL, KERNEL32:
                o Compile fixes for VAC 3.6.5
    - RASAPI32: o Can't use LXLITE as it crashes on this binary
    - KERNEL32: o Check handle in LocalLock and return NULL if invalid
                  (some apps use LocalLock to get access to GDI objects; doesn't
                   work in Odin (TODO))

 2001-02-10: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Check if window has been destroyed before accessing
                  this pointer again in SendInternalMessage.
                  (fixes heap corruption in MS Visual C++ 4.2 install)
                  TODO: Needs a permanent and correct solution as this
                        can happen in several other places.
                        Also a potential problem in user32 controls (InfoPtr).
                o Set last error to ERROR_INVALID_INDEX for invalid class word
                  index.

 2001-02-09: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - COMCTL32: o Register controls in LibMain, not in DLL_InitTerm
    - KERNEL32: o Re-register dll if DosFreeModule failed with ERROR_INVALID_ACCESS
                  Dll refuses to unload if it has an active exitlist handler
                  or depends on a dll that registered an exitlist handler.
                  In this case the handle remains valid and the entrypoint of
                  the dll is NOT called for DLL_PROCESS_DETACH. The next time
                  DosLoadModule is called, the entrypoint (and RegisterLXDll)
                  isn't called (DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH).
                  WORKAROUND: Re-register the dll so future functions that
                              use this dll calls don't fail.
                  (fixes crash in shell32 in TextPad 4)
                o shared & code heap umalloc changed (now more meaningful debug
                  messages in case of heap corruption)
    - USER32:   o WM_MINIMIZE/WS_MAXIMIZE support added to CreateWindow
                  (fixes size of main InstallShield window for Microsoft Visual
                   C++ 4.2)
                o Fixed FS corruption in DIALOG_DlgDirList (c library function calls)

 2001-02-08: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Standard in/out/error handle fix. Disable change during
                  console init.
                  (fixes output of console applications; input doesn't work well yet)
    - USER32:   o Dialog control fix. Creating them with CreateWindowExW does not
                  work since our standard user32 controls are still ASCII.
                  (fixes missing icon control in Acrobat Distiller window)

 2001-02-08: Michal Necasek <michalnec@volny.cz>
    - KERNEL32: o RtlUnwind bugfix

 2001-02-04: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Wrong error set in GetDlgItem. Must be ERROR_CONTROL_ID_NOT_FOUND.
                  (verified in NT4, SP6)

 2001-02-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Get/SetWindowLongA/W, Get/SetWindowWord: must set
                  last error to ERROR_INVALID_WINDOW_HANDLE if window not found.
                  (verified in NT4, SP6)
                  Must also return ERROR_INVALID_INDEX if index is out of range.
                  (used to return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER) (verified in NT4, SP6)
                o Temporary hack to force focus to newly created window
                  (if no Odin window has focus after sending WM_ACTIVATE, set
                   focus to window that received the activate message)
                  (fixes wrong keyboard focus in RealPlayer 8)

 2001-02-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o DrawEdge bugfixes (signed/unsigned char mismatches)
                  (fixes lines in properties dialog of RealPlayer 8)
                o Fixed incorrect rounding in dialog control size calculation
                  (fixes wrong height of some dialog controls (rp8 pref. dialog lines))
                o Don't unregister class if there are still windows that use it.

 2001-02-02: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   o Added option for the All-In-One-Object fix to be able
                  to debug PE executables thru the ICAT. Works with pe2lx
                  and win32k.sys.
                  -1<+|-|[*]>
                    +: Applied when needed.                 (checked)
                    -: Never applied (use this to debug).   (not checked)
                    *: Allways applied. (default)           (gray)
                  It's also added to Win32kCC as a three state checkbutton.

                  WARNING! This option should only be used for debugging
                  and will cause your system to crash if used with based
                  images!
    - tools\Common:
                o Minor changes in the fileformat classes to use kFile.

 2001-02-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - GDI32:    o LineDDA fix (wrong calling convention)
                  (fixes crash in Solitaire)
    - USER32:   o clientHeight bugfix. Check hwnd instead of pHps->hwnd.
                  (pHps can be NULL)
                  (fixes crash in Solitaire)
    - INSTALL:  o Include ChangeLog-2001 in daily build
    - COMDLG32: o Merged some changes from Wine (extra notification in
                  FileOpenDlgProc95 & OFN_NOCHANGEDIR support (also added
                  to Unicode version of file open dialog))
                o Removed workaround for Acrobat Reader file open dialog
                  (Wine update fixed it)

 2000-01-30: Markus Montkowski <mmontkowski@gmx.de>
    - KERNEL32: o Fixed handling of fbTimeout in DCBINFO in SetOS2DCB and
                  SetCommTimeouts the last one prevented Palms Hotsync to 
                  work with normal IBM com.sys.
                  SIO did less parameterchecking so it worked...

    - KERNEL32: o Memory map commit bugfix for write accesses
                  (fixes eternal loop in OLE during IE5 install)
    - NTDLL:    o Ported latest NtQuerySystemInformation from Wine 
                  (includes fix for IE5 install)
    - OLE32:    o Resync with latest Wine (storage, stg_*)

 2001-01-24: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Default display and windows codepage set to 1252

 2001-01-23: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o long2ShortName completely broken. now properly detects 8.3
                  filename and copies it (TODO: not finished)
                o Set x position to 0 after seeing a linefeed in the WriteFile
                  datastream (vio console)
                  (Sun Java 1.3 output doesn't include carriage returns)
                o ExitProcess change: make sure no threads are still suspended 
                  (with SuspendThread) by calling ResumeThread
                  OS/2 seems to be unable to terminate the process otherwise.
                  (fixes exitlist zombie after executing the Sun Java 1.3 interpreter)
                o Added handle manager class for standard handles (in/out/error)
                  WriteFile for STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE & STD_ERROR_HANDLE now works.
    - PELDR:    o Don't strip quotes from cmd line parameter part.
                  (fixes Sun Java 1.3 JRE install (must replace 16 bits setup
                   with 32 bits version))
    - INCLUDE\win\thread.h:
                o Wrong layout of TEB structure
                  (fixes crash in Sun Java 1.3 interpreter)

 2001-01-22: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o CreateFileMapping fix; create new handle even when called
                  with name of existing map (and return ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS)
                o _HMHandleGetFree fix; handle allocation wasn't thread safe
                  (_HMHandleGetFree checks if hHMHandle == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE,
                   but calling functions sets this value afterwards -> possible
                   that two threads allocate the same handle)
                  (solution: set hHMHandle in _HMHandleGetFree)
                  HMCreatePipe call also failed because of this. (two handles
                  allocated -> both allocate the same handle)
                o HMCreatePipe change (free 1st handle if 2nd handle alloc fails)
    - DOC\Readme.txt:
                o Added remark about the need to run odininst.exe when installing
                  Odin manually.
                o Updates

 2000-01-21: Przemyslaw Dobrowolski <dobrawka@asua.org.pl>
    - WINMM/MCICDA:
                o Track data fixes

 2001-01-20: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - tools\dailybuild, include\versionos2.h:
                o Fixed netlabs upload.
                o Moved buildlevel info from versionos2.h to odinbuild.h.

 2001-01-20: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - AVIFIL32: o Resynched with latest Wine code
                o Added AVIStreamTimeToSample & AVIStreamSampleToTime stubs
    - SETUPAPI: o Wine port (stubs only)

 2001-01-20: Yuri Dario <mc6530@mclink.it>
    - USER32:   o Set codepage for DCs returned by GetDCEx

 2000-01-20: Przemyslaw Dobrowolski <dobrawka@asua.org.pl>
    - WINMM/MCICDA:
                o MCI_STATUS_POSITION bugfix

 2001-01-19: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o GetCaretPos & SetCaretPos bugfixes. Did not take client
                  window origin into account.
                  (fixes cursor position problems in e.g. Notepad)

 2000-01-19: Przemyslaw Dobrowolski <dobrawka@asua.org.pl>
    - WNASPI32: o DosCreateMutexSem call bugfix.
                  (CDRWIN works again)

 2001-01-19: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   o Added support for kernel revisions. (like 14062A)
                o Added build 14062a kernels.
                o Added build 14062 kernels for Warp 4.

 2001-01-18: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - GDI32:    o More logging
                o Use StretchDIBits in SetDIBitsToDevice instead of Open32
                  function. (which doesn't work for compressed bitmaps)
                  (MS Excel 97 startup bitmap displays correctly now)
                  Also solves y inversion related problems.
                  (MS Developer startup bitmap overlay correct now (Visual C++ logo))
    - WGSS50:   o Reported problems with SaveDC/RestoreDC and StretchDIBits
                  (Modelator graphics corruption fixed)
    - KERNEL32: o Create system.ini with '[mci] cdaudio=mcicda.drv' section
                  during installation
                o Fixed bug in lstrncpyA (return when specified length is 0)
                o MultiByteToWideChar bugfix (calculate string length if input
                  length is -1 before checking if dest length is 0)
                  (MS Word 97 no longer crashes)
                o RegQueryValueExW bugfix
                  (caused stack corruption in Excel and probably many other
                   apps that use this function too)
    - OLEAUT32: o Ported David's typelib changes.
                  (MS Word 97 starts immediately and doesn't spend an hour
                   searching for typelibs in dlls)
                  TODO: Check bugfixes/changes in latest Wine code and merge
                        them.
                  TODO: Port picture classes

 2000-01-17: Przemyslaw Dobrowolski <dobrawka@asua.org.pl>
    - WINMM\MCICDA:
                o Wrong call to os2CDCloseTray

 2001-01-13: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - COMDLG32: o Get current directory if initial dir == NULL (win31 style
                  file dialog).
                o Fix for filter. (default to NULL; not " /0/0")
                o Scale icons to 16x16 (win31 style file dialog) -> system
                  default (32x32) is too big. (TODO: Our user32 icons are too
                  big)
                o Drive list not initialized correctly. (GetDriveTypeA return
                  value interpreted wrong)
                  -> use GetLogicalDrives instead to avoid accessing floppy
                     drives (which GetDriveType does)
    - USER32:   o Replaced some icons with those found in SHELL32:
                  - open & closed folder
                  - floppy, harddisk & network drive
                o Fixed bug in NotifyFormatFrame method (fixes problems
                  with combobox)
                o ComboLBox bugfix (extra vertical scrollbar)
                o LISTBOX_Directory bugfix (must check for FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL)
                  (removes files from directory listing in common file dialog)
    - KERNEL32: o Fix for executable names with spaces in path
                o Workaround for applications that block the PM input queue
                  while waiting for a child process to terminate.
                  (WaitSingleObject now calls MsgWaitMultipleObjects and
                   processes messages while waiting for the process to die)
                  (Napster install now doesn't block PM anymore (forcing a reboot))
                o Add class keys for SHDOCVW during install
    - SHDOCVW:  o Added (Wine 20010112 port)
    - WSOCK32:  o Changed File and Product version to 0x0400, 0x0565012C (NT4, SP6)

 2001-01-12: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - tools\install, tools\dailybuild:
                o Added odincrt.dll to debug release (to make wgss50.dll happy).

 2001-01-11: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o DrawIconEx bugfix (fixes bitmap menu item when maximizing
                  MDI window)
    - COMDLG32: o Added/Ported 16 bits common dialog Wine code.
                  (GetOpen/SaveFileName with hook and without OFN_EXPLORER
                   flag implies old Windows 3.1 style dialog)
                  (not completely working yet, but better than the mess we
                   saw before (InstallShield -> browse dir))

 2001-01-10: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Fix for WriteFile & ReadFile (wrong return code was expected)
    - USER32:   o HAS_THICKFRAME macro changed (identical to Wine now)
                  (fixes MDI window borders (which were too thin))

 2001-01-10: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - tools\install:
                o Corrected packing of wpss50.dll.
                o Added .sym files to release distributions. (optional package)

    - tools\dailybuild:
                o Removed uploading of glide-stuff.

 2001-01-09: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - INCLUDE\dcdata, GDI32, USER32:
                o Updates for WGSS50.

    - LIB\WGSS50.lib, BIN\WGSS50.dll:
                o Binary distribution of WGSS50 added

 2001-01-09: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - tools\dailybuild:
                o Added wgss50.dll to the .ZIPs.

    - lib       o Added making of wgss50.lib.
                  (So, that it corresponds to the other libraries made there.)
                o Converted wgss50.lib to a deffile.

 2001-01-08: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - ReportingBugs.txt:
                o Specify windows & system32 directory in bug reports
                  (description included on how to determine this)

 2001-01-08: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - tools\dailybuild:
                o Updated with temporary server address.
                o Put ftp userid/passwords into separate file.
                o Build number incrementation. (Stored in versionos2.h)
                  (Use bldlevel on the DLLs to look at it.)
                o Splitted out 3dxf/glide stuff into separat .zips.

    - Win32k:   o Added support for the ldrCheckInternalName bug. :-)
                  (see /src/win32k/ldr/myldrCheckInternalName.cpp for details.)
                o Made pe.exe default.
                o Added UNI and SMP 14062 kernels (convenience pack).
                  (Have anyone got the Warp 4 convenience pack with the right .sym files?)

    - bin\bldlevelinf.cmd:
                o Removed colon after otherwise to make it work with Object REXX.

    - makefiles:
                o Merged BuildLevel revisions with the LXOpt revisions.
                  (There seems like there have been some kind of revision mixup in
                   Sanders tree?)
                o Updated the other post files with LXOpt.

 2001-01-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - install:  o Win32k installation temporarily disabled due to a WarpIn bug
                  (config.sys lines removed)
                o Update: This is NOT a WarpIn bug, but an error in the script.
                          Now fixed.
                o Added check for WarpIn 0.9.6 or higher
                o Added check for OS/2 3.x or higher
    - src\makefile:
                o Exclude msvcrt from build process.
                  (download odinapp.zip from ftp.os2.org to install a small
                   MFC app with MFC + MSVCRT dlls)

 2001-01-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - makefiles:o Use LXLite for release build binaries (better compression)
                  Can't use it for debug binaries as IPMD doesn't like it.

 2001-01-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o KERNEL32_99 should return 1 (according to Wine)
                o KERNEL32_100 export added (stub)
    - USER32:   o Rewrote window handle management; only start reusing window
                  handles when max handle has been assigned.
    - GDI32/USER32/KERNEL32:
                o Don't export private Odin functions by name (we import
                  everything by ordinal)

 2001-01-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Menu cast bugfix (bitmap handle is 32 bits)
                  (Fixes menu bitmaps in Lotus Notes 5)
