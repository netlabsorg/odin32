	- WNASPI32: full implementation via ASPIROUT$ device driver.

 99-09-19: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>

	- USER32:   Fix: window focus management.
		    OSLIBWIN.H: the definitions of OSLIB_HWND_DESKTOP and
		    OSLIB_HWND_OBJECT were 1 off (with respect to the definition
		    in PMWIN.H)! So OSLIB_HWND_DESKTOP was in effect NULLHANDLE,
		    and OSLIB_HWND_OBJECT was HWND_DESKTOP.

		    Bugfixes for unicode resource apis.
		    Not completely tested yet, but works for most apps.
	  NOTE:     Resource handling for pe2lx & win32 apps compiled in OS/2
		    will be added in the near future. For now it's compatible
		    with the old pe2lx.
	  NOTE:     New kernel32 doesn't work with old user32
	  NOTE:     Win32Resource::lockResource not complete yet, but that part
		    will be removed after the pe2lx rewrite.
	- USER32:   Moved new user32 into user32 dir, old one to user32\old
	- ALL:	    Changed initterm.cpp to create LX dll object during initialization.
	  IMPORTANT NOTE: Version increased from 3 to 4. Complete recompilation
