 2001-10-08: Patrick Haller <patrick.haller@innotek.de>
    - USER32:   o enabled WH_KEYBOARD_LL hook, seems to work
    - KERNEL32: o added further error codes to error2WinError

 2001-10-08: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED: activation fix; must clear FF_NOACTIVATESWP
                  if mp2 & AWP_ACTIVATE
                  (fixes activation of some inactive windows; used to be
                   activated but not brought to the top)

 2001-10-07: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - DDRAW:    o Don't use Dive for blitting to/from 8 bpp surfaces
    - USER32:   o Eliminated flickering during frame sizing due to 
                  unnecessary drawing
                o Fixed handling of WM_SIZING/WM_MOVING (changing rectangles)
                o WM_TRACKFRAME: call Frame_SysCommandSizeMove with SC_MOVE+HTCAPTION

 2001-10-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - QUARTZ/OLEAUT32: 
                o Wine 20011004 resync
    - KERNEL32: o Reduce overhead for heap allocation
                o Always allocate heap memory from high memory (if available)
                o Allocate extra heap memory in 64kb units
                  MUST use 64kb here or else we are at risk of running out 
                  of virtual memory space. (when allocating 4kb we actually 
                  get 4kb + 60k uncommited)
                  (fixes out of resources error while loading big movies 
                   in The Playa)

 2001-10-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - DDRAW:    o Added stretching support for blitting to the screen
                  (the Playa can now play movies in fullscreen mode)

 2001-10-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - WINMM:    o Allocate handle for new timer and verify handle
                  is valid before using it. 
                  (prevents crashes when app attempts to delete timer twice
                   (DivX 4))
    - DDRAW:    o Fixed memory leaks in SurfBlt4 (rectangles)
                o Take clipping into account in SurfBlt4. Windowed DirectDraw
                  blitting now seems to work well. 
                  (only tried DivX 4; needs more testing)
    - USER32:   o Rewrote sizing & moving of windows (frame tracking)
                  (ported Wine version + fixed some bugs)
                  Some applications (e.g. RealPlayer) resize themselves
                  when receiving WM_SIZING msgs. Not possible to send those
                  with PM's frame tracking.
                  TODO: fix flickering of size border (dynamic drag off)
                  TODO: WM_SIZING handling not 100% correct yet
                  TODO: Must display size/move cursor when starting action
                        from system menu
                o GetDCEx change; always call WinGetClipPS (!CS_OWNDC)
    - OLEAUT32: o Wine update

 2001-10-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - REGSVR32: o Must use LoadLibrary, not CoLoadLibrary
                  (Some dlls (divx codec) call CoFreeUnusedLibraries which 
                   unloads the same dll if we use CoLoadLibrary (-> crash)
                   NT's regsvr32 doesn't use CoLoadLibrary either)
    - USER32:   o OSLibWinGetMsg bugfix

 2001-10-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Lastest Wine revision of GetNextDlgGroupItem ported + modified
