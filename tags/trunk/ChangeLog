		    When it's completed, it should fix several problems due to
	  	    differences between OS/2's TIB and Win32's TEB.

	- GDI32: Fixed SetDIBitsToDevice bugfix (palette size)
	- USER32: Fixed RegisterSystemClasses

 99-07-06: Achim Hasenmueller
	- Added comctl32, mostly untested includes all controls, some undocumented

                    exception! (fixes annoying exitlist hangs)

	- KERNEL32: Winimage.cpp, extra checks added

    	- KERNEL32: fixed a open32 bug (or win32 feature) - WriteFile with
      	  nrbytes = 0 is equal to a SetEndOfFile(..);

 98-17-08: Sander van Leeuwen
	- KERNEL32: Changed LoadLibraryA(W/ExA/ExW) to try to load the dll
		    directly first and if that fails, load it manually.

		 (ddex1-ddex5 DirectX SDK samples work(ed) + Quake 2 in

	  to set the module name in the resident name table
	  (otherwise converted dll will not load)

	- LocalReAlloc bugfix, notepad assumes it returns the same
	  address when the new size is smaller than the old one.

 98-03-08 KSO:
	- pe.cpp:	line 600 - added OS2Exe to the parameterlist
	- bitmap.cpp: replace file - much.

			  entry points
	- USER32: Changed class managment code
	- USER32: Removed all SYNCPAINT stuff as it breaks many apps
	- USER32: Removed in CreateWindowExA that checks for values of x, y, nHeight & nWidth
		  (this broke generic.exe, notepad.exe and probably many others)
	- USER32: Finished GetMenuStringW (MSPaint), not working right though
		  it should return 'Recent File', but returns 'Decent File'
		  Well, whatever.
	- VERSION/KERNEL32/PE2LX: Version resource API implemention started
	- PE2LX:  Increased some fixup limits to convert dynhgi35.dll
	- KERNEL32: AsciiToUnicode fixed (only terminate with one 0; doing
		    it twice corrupts the heap as our stuff allocates exactly
		    enough for string + 0 terminator)

 98-07-14: Sander van Leeuwen
	- KERNEL32: Changed OS2GetProcAddress to call the ordinal or name getApi
		    method
