 2000-05-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- USER32:   Fixed window property functions (ported from Wine)
                    The old ones used Open32 functions which no longer work
                    due to atom api changes a few months ago.

 2000-05-04: Achim Hasenmueller <achimha@innotek.de>
	- USER32:   Applied fix to GetDCEx where the check to see if
  	            the window has its own DC was applying invalid
	            style flags due to missing parantheses
	            (reported by Oliver Braun)

 2000-05-04: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- USER32:   Menu font from bold to normal again. Bold fonts are too
                    big (rp7 menu split in two parts).

 2000-05-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- WSOCK32:  Fixed WSAEFAULT errors in setsockopt (16 bits TCP/IP stack
                    doesn't like high addresses; similar problems can also occur 
                    elsewhere in wsock32)
	- USER32:   Change settings return by SystemParameterInfo for SPI_GETNONCLIENTMETRICS
                    Caption & menu fonts now bold; different sizes (more like Wine now)
                    Set/clear WS_VISIBLE flag in SetWindowPos; don't call 
                    ShowWindow.
                    Implemented Set/Get/ReleaseCapture without Open32
                    Release capture for window that is about to be disabled
                    Send WM_CAPTURECHANGED messages when capture changes
                    
 2000-05-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- KERNEL32: GetLocaleInfoA/W fix (size of buffer for i.e. LOCALE_IDATE
                    should be >= 2, not > 2)
                    VirtualFree: Check for ERROR_ALIAS return value

                    Ported and changed/fixed XFolder stack dump code (symbol file only)
                    When a win32 app crashes, a dump of the stack is written
                    in odin32_0.log.
	- USER32:   Merged some Wine dialog changes (setting focus + font size)
                    Extra logging for some apis
                    Added support for RDW_FRAME flag to GetDCEx
	- INCLUDE\makefiles: Added rule for converting map to symfile
                             A symbol file is now created for each exe/dll
	- INCLUDE\ODINWRAP: Turned off profiling by default. 
                            Our log is big enough as it is without even
                            more logging.

        - makefile and tools/makefile:
                    tools/install is not a "needed tool" required for
                    to do the rest of the build; and it'is dependent on
                    kernel32.lib which haven't been made at the time
                    the needed_tools are being made. So, the making of
                    tools/install is the last thing we do in the makeprocess.
        - WSOCK32, WINMM:
                    ODINWRAP changes below broke WSOCK32 and WINMM.
                    I've created some highly temporary fix for it this problem.
                    Could someone please make a permanent fix?
        - tools/bin/wrc.exe and tools/wrc:
                    Important notice: __WIN32OS2__ is not defined when making wrc!
                    This was the reason why ':' was used as include separator.
                    This is corrected now. ';' is now the include separator.
                    A new wrc.exe has been checked in.
