    - KERNEL32: Unstubbed CopyFileExA/W (calls CopyFileA/W; not properly implemented)
                Unstubbed CreateDirectoryExA/W (calls CreateDirectoryA/W; not properly implemented)
                Fixed GetShortPathNameA/W; don't touch short path parameter if
                it's NULL; behaviour (as seen in NT 4, SP6):
                - converts long filename to 8.3 short filname (TODO: not yet done here!)
                - fails on volume that doesn't support 8.3 filenames
                - if lpszShortPath 0 or cchBuffer too small -> return required length
                  (INCLUDING 0 terminator)
                - if lpszLongPath == NULL -> ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER (return 0)
                - if lpszLongPath empty -> proceed as if nothing is wrong
                  (Wine claims it sets last error to ERROR_BAD_PATHNAME)
                - does NOT clear the last error if successful!
                - if successful -> return length of string (excluding 0 terminator)
    - USER32:   Fixed adding windows to tasklist (done too late)
    - GDI32/USER32:
                - Rewrote Set/GetViewportExtEx, Set/GetMapMode & moved them
                  from gdi32 to user32

    - KERNEL32: Added IsDebuggerPresent (debug.cpp). Returns FALSE, but by
                SETing ODIN32.DEBUGGERPRESENT=1 it will return TRUE. (Some
                application might issue calls to OutputDebugString if they
                think they're being debugged.)
                Moved OutputDebugString(A/W) to debug.cpp.

 2000-07-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - RICHED32: Fixed bug when creating edit window (needs to be WS_CHILD)
    - USER32:   Fixed moving of child windows in MsgFormatFrame & move
                child windows if only client rectangle changes
                (fixes Acrobat Distiller window)
    - SHELL32:  Put back check for registration of ShellView window class
                -> RegisterClass now fails if already registered
                (fixed openfile dialogs)
