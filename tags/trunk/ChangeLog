                o Corrected makefile. No memory debug.
    - CMDQD:    o Corrected makefile.

    - Tools/DailyBuilds:

    - COMMON:   o Implemented parsing of the SEGMENTS in a definition file
                  (class kFileDef), in order to produce better watcom linker
                  directives.

 2002-08-28: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - DDRAW:    o Added custom function to hide mouse cursor when the primary
                  surface (screen) is locked by the app to prevent display
                  corruption with color/animated mouse pointers.

 2002-08-27: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin   >
    - FASTDEP:  o Tweaked cyclic dependency checks performance a little bit more.
    - MAKE      o Splitted out linker and library configs into separat config
                  files. Both to have less files to update, and to be able to
                  easer choose linker or archiver.
                o Tried to make ilink and optional linker for watcom, but
                  it produces bad executable files. Will fix this later.

                o Fixed the 16 bits mess (incorrect handle conversion)

 2002-08-23: Yuri Dario <mc6530@mclink   >
    - TOOLS:    o VAC40 filter fixes for mapsym.cmd.

 2002-08-23: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin   >
    - TOOLS:    o Made mapsym.cmd quiet on 4os2 too.
                o Made BldLevelInf.cmd respecting BUILD_VERBOSE and BUILD_QUIET;
                  and fixed an old typo.
                o Update the Do* and BldLevelInf.cmd with novalue signalhandlers.
                  (Something all rexx script should use!)
    - MAKE:     o Completed Odin32 config.
                o Default target is DLL, but if CUSTOMBUILD defined LIB.
    - ADVAPI32, ODINCRT:

                  calls DestroyWindow for parent or owner in WM_DESTROY handler
                  (solution: postpone DestroyWindow for parent/owner)

 2002-08-23: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin   >
    - TOOLS:    o Added a rm.exe binary from the OS2Tools tree.
                  The new build system uses this. Then clean will
                  work everywhere!

 2002-08-22: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >

                o Made SUBDIRS and PRE/POSTMAKEFILES more customizable by
                  adding support for override macros:
                     [SUBDIRS|[PRE|POST]MAKEFILES]_<mainrule>
                  This is good when you wanna skip a tree for a rule (=pass)
                  or/and just run do a rule (=pass) in a specific tree.
                o Added check for TARGET_PRIVATE macro before installing
                  anything.
    - CMDQD, FASTDEP:
                o Made makefiles support the new build system.

    - USER32:   o Don't send queued WM_CHAR messages for windows that have
                  just been destroyed. (Get/PeekMessage)

    - DINPUT:   o Merged with latest Wine (DirectInput 8 support)
                o Added bugfix from June 18th:
                  SysMouseAImpl_GetDeviceData: check if internal dinput
                  mouse state is out of sync and update if necessary
    - USER32:   o SetCursorPos change:
                  The current cursor position may not have been passed to the application
                  just yet. The position change discards any previous events which may
                  lead to inconsistent mouse behaviour (like in DirectInput).
                  To fix this, we pass down a mouse move event to any hook handlers.

                o Enable owner of window destroyed by DestroyWindow. Disabled

 2002-08-12: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - COMCTL32: o Tooltips: ignore TTS_ALWAYSTIP style. Windows 2000 appears
                  to do the same.

                  letter.
    - OLE32:    o Disabled mouse cursor changes in drag 'n drop code.
                  (causes mouse cursor changes when clicking on item in
                   file open dialog)
