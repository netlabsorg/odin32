 2001-09-30: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - INCLUDE:  o Hook constants added to winconst.h
                  (adding them to winuser.h only completely breaks Odin)
    - DDRAW:    o Implemented IDirectDrawClipper class for windowed DirectDraw
                  (only works if app uses clipping info for manual blitting;
                   IDirectSurface blitting methods need to be updated to
                   take clipping into account)
    - USER32:   o Added export to registery visible region change callback

 2001-09-30: knut st. osmundsen <kosmunds@csc.com>
    - Makefiles:
                o Added a DOMAKES util which should be used when invoking
                  other makefiles. (see /src/kernel32/makefile)
                o Silenced most of the command $(DO*) commands so the commandline
                  doesn't show.
                o Added some colors on the output from the $(DO*) scripts
                  to make it easier to separate directory and makefile switching
                  from all the other output.
                  Turn this off by using the env.var. BUILD_NOCOLOR.
                o Did some cleanup of the main Makefile and added some missing rules.
                o Made separate .depend file for the include files in the /include dir.
                  This will speedup the 'dep' rule somewhat.
                o Autostart CmdQd with 7 workers if not started and MULTIJOBS are defined.
                o Profile builds uses ./bin/Profile.* subdir for output, not ./bin/Debug.*.
    - Fastdep:  o Corrected processing of C/C++ #include "someheader.h" to
                  start the search in the source code directory.
                o Corrected handling of deleted files.
                o Increased some read and write buffers.
    - Win32k:   o Changed PSZ to char *, since H2INC doesn't understand PSZ.
    - Custombulid:
                o Can now build object libraries for custombuild without separate
                  makefiles. Define CUSTOMBUILD=1 (=1 is important!) to build an
                  DLL.
                o To build all needed object libraries and the custom dll,
                  go to /src and 'nmake custombuild'. There is currently no
                  rule in the main makefile for this, so remember to make the
                  libraries in /lib first.
                o Removed all the obsolete *lib.mak files.

 2001-09-29: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - WGSS50:   o WGSS update

 2001-09-28: Patrick Haller <patrick.haller@innotek.de>
    - USER32:   o added experimental support for WH_KEYBOARD_LL hook
                o implemented keybd_event, mouse_event (-> SendInput )

 2001-09-28: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - PE2LX:    o Added options to remove fixups and to reroute all
                  imports to a custom odin dll

 2001-09-27: Patrick Haller <patrick.haller@innotek.de>
    - USER32:   o partial implementation of SendInput()
    - KERNEL32: o improved error code mapping (error2WinError)
                o keep HandleManager from reusing last handle
                  too quickly (CreateFile after CloseHandle might
                  return the same handle again, which is correct but doesn't
                  put the spotlight on buggy apps)

 2001-09-26: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - WININET/ICMP/WS2_32/WINSPOOL/CTL3D32:
                o Makefiles added to build library with obj files
    - WININET:  o Split up initterm
    - CUSTOMBUILD:
                o Ordinals definitions moved into ordinals.h

 2001-09-26: knut st. osmundsen <kosmunds@csc.com>
    - Win32k:   o Create development branch 'splittup' which in the
                  splittup of win32k is being implemented.
                o BTW. I think I've found the jfs/fat32 + win32k problem.
                  I left some dirty readonly heap pages behind...
                  That is corrected in the splittup.
    - Some Makefiles:
                o Corrected the file header to state correct dllname.
                  Ye][ow, which is doing some documentation stuff on the Odin32,
                  pointed this out this for me.

 2001-09-26: Patrick Haller <patrick.haller@innotek.de>
    - ODINWRAP: o fixed FNEPILOGUE position
      (MISC)    o added support for calldepth tracing

    - DDRAW/ADVAPI32: Added makefiles for building library with obj files

 2001-09-24: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - DDRAW:    o Set screen resolution + bpp of primary surface to those
                  of the PM desktop. (used to default to 640x480x8bpp)

 2001-09-24: Patrick Haller <patrick.haller@innotek.de>
    - USER32:   o added ODINWRAP debug tracing support to WINKEYBOARD.CPP

 2001-09-23: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o MDI bugfix: set active child to 0 when last one is destroyed
                  (fixes crash when closing mdi window in odinapp)
    - GDI32:    o DIB Section sync bugfix; GpiQueryBitmapBits fails
                  when cbImage is too small (compressed images only)
                  This used to work. Maybe related to new SDD version.
                  (CoolEdit 2000 hits breakpoint in debug build)

 2001-09-23: Dietrich Teickner <Dietrich_Teickner@t-online.de>

 2001-09-20: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Activate window when it returns 0 for WM_MOUSEACTIVATE
                  0 is not documented, but experiments in NT4 show that
                  the window will get activated when it returns this.
                  (fixes activation of FreeCell when clicking on the window)
                o WM_NEXTMENU bugfix (from Wine)
                  (fixes crash during menu navigation in MDI windows)
    - SHELL32:  o Shell Folder bugfix from Wine added

 2000-09-19: Oliver Braun <Oliver.Braun@hamburg.de>
    - USER32:   o PeekMessageW bugfix

 2001-09-19: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Changed GetLastActivePopup (still not complete)
                o Prevent loop in DIALOG_IsAccelerator
                o GetMenuItemInfoW bugfixes
                o Ported the Wine MDI control

 2001-09-17: Patrick Haller <patrick.haller@innotek.de>

 2001-09-17: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Must return AWP_ACTIVATE/AWP_DEACTIVATE flags in
                  WM_ADJUSTWINDOWPOS (SWP_ACTIVATE/SWP_DEACTIVATE).
                  This ensures activation is handled properly.
                  No longer necessary to manually send WM_ACTIVATE messages.
                o Only forward SC_CLOSE syscommand to top level window
                  if generated by keyboard

 2001-09-15: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Some focus/activation changes
                o Translation fix for WM_SYSCOMMAND; SC_CLOSE now always
                  directed to top-level window. (OS/2 look only)
    - ODINBUG:  o Update by Herwig Bauernfeind
    - OLEAUT32/OLE32/QUARTZ/COMDLG32:
                o Wine updates
    - COMCTL32: o Wine updates for toolbar, pager & rebar controls
                o Treeview bugfix when deleting the selected item
                  (fixes crash in UltraEdit when opening files)
    - *         o Put back original sources. Extremely annoying to
                  add tags and change tabs in files.

 2001-09-11: knut st. osmundsen <kosmunds@csc.com>
    - kKrnlLib: o FYI: Win32k revamp/split-up. Not yet completed.

 2001-09-10: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o VirtualQuery fix; DosQueryMem doesn't always return region
                  size in pages, so round up size to next page boundary
                  (fixes loop during Netscape 4.7 startup)
    - GDI32:    o DPtoLP fix; signed/unsigned comparison failed
                  (fixes huge fonts in Netscape 4.7)
                o StretchDIBits fix; clear ulCompression for BI_BITFIELDS
                  or else WGSS blit will fail
                  (fixes black pictures in Netscape 4.7)

    - TAPI32:   o Some updates
    - OLEAUT32: o Wine typelib updates

 2001-09-07: Patrick Haller <patrick.haller@innotek.de>
    - include:  o removed ./include/wine/server.h (Wine Server)
                  because of collisiton with server.h in OS/2 toolkit
    - WNETAP32: o NetServerEnum implemented
                o split into numerous smaller source modules

 2001-09-05: knut st. osmundsen <kosmunds@csc.com>
    - src\*:    o Added/fixed CVS $Id tag in source files.
                  Sorry, if this caused long checkout and compilation. :-)

 2001-09-04: knut st. osmundsen <kosmunds@csc.com>

 2001-09-01: knut st. osmundsen <kosmunds@csc.com>
    - Tools\CmdQd:
                o Do DosExecPgm directly on programs when possible.
                  (It's not possible if multiple commands is specified in a job.)
                o Path search result caching.
                o Uses CMD.EXE nomatter what is in the COMSPEC.
