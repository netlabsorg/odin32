 2000-10-01: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
    - KERNEL32: Optimization of PROFILE calls
    - GDI32:    Fix for uncompressed/RGB bitmaps (biSizeImage == 0)
    - WINMM:    Fix for timer logic - timers still quite untested

 2000-10-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: Fixed bug introduced by recent command line changes
                (executables with spaces in name/dir)
    - GDI32:    Implemented AddFontResourceW

 2000-10-01: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   ú Added IOCtl API for Reading or Writing into another process'
                  address space. (*ProcessReadWrite)
                  This is intended used to implemented ReadProcessMemory and
                  WriteProcessMemory (which is essensial to debuggers I think).
                  I'll implementet them soon, but it sees that it'll
                  require more changes in process.c that I first thought.
                ú Simplified maintaince of kernel imports. (mkcalltab)
                  Removed unused imports.
