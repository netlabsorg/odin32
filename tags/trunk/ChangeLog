    - SHLWAPI:  Rewrote VERSION_OsIsUnicode (same as SHELL_OsIsUnicode now)
    - RICHED32: 'Handle' WM_SETTEXT messages. Wine's richedit dll is very
                incomplete. It's better to use the native windows version.
    - KERNEL32: Ported Wine's LoadModule (previously used Open32)
                Changed version apis
                You can now tell Odin to tell applications it's either
                Windows 98 or Windows NT 4.0 (default = NT40)
                Odin.ini:
                [WinVersion]
                Version=Win98
    - OLE32:    Added stubs for CoGetInstanceFromFile & CoGetInstanceFromIStorage

 2000-10-02: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
    - GDI32:    fixed possible error in text.cpp (strrchr)
    - WNETAP32: started implementation of LAN Manager support :)
    - KERNEL32: added HEAP_size export

 2000-10-02: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - KERNEL32: Fixed Pe2Lx (ie. Win32k) TLS problem. Beyond Compare works.
    - Common:   Added very limited dump capability to kFilePE. (Used to
                understand TLS.)

 2000-10-01: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
    - KERNEL32: Optimization of PROFILE calls
    - GDI32:    Fix for uncompressed/RGB bitmaps (biSizeImage == 0)
    - WINMM:    Fix for timer logic - timers still quite untested

 2000-10-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: Fixed bug introduced by recent command line changes
                (executables with spaces in name/dir)
    - GDI32:    Implemented AddFontResourceW

 2000-10-01: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   ú Added IOCtl API for Reading or Writing into another process'
                  address space. (*ProcessReadWrite)
                  This is intended used to implemented ReadProcessMemory and
                  WriteProcessMemory (which is essensial to debuggers I think).
                  I'll implementet them soon, but it sees that it'll
                  require more changes in process.c that I first thought.
                ú Simplified maintaince of kernel imports. (mkcalltab)
                  Removed unused imports.
