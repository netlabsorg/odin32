 2002-10-03: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Implemented IOCTL_CDROM_RAW_READ

 2002-10-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Be careful with stack usage in exception handler during
                  XCPT_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION. 

 2002-09-30: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - SHELL32:  o Fixed crash when deleting a file in the file dialog
    - KERNEL32: o Fixes for volume access

 2002-09-30: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - COMDLG32: o File dialogs: if lpstrInitialDir is not a dir but a filename
                  skip it and use current directory

 2002-09-27: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o GetFileSize must fail for drives
                o Disable physical disk & volume access by default; 
                  call EnablePhysicalDiskAccess to enable it (custom build)
                o FindFirst/NextVolumeA fixes for ignoring LVM volumes

 2002-09-26: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o OS/2 Physical partition names have base 1 (0 for win32)
                o Convert ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND to ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND in
                  OSLibDosCreateFile
                o IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY fix for physical drive
                o Fixed return value for FindNextVolumeMountPointA/W
                o Fixed read & write for unmounted volumes; must update
                  current file position manually & check for boundaries
    - WINMM:    o Fixed debug wrapper logging
    - USER32:   o WM_ADJUSTFRAMEPOS:
                  The PM frame control changes the z-order of a child window
                  if it receives focus after a window has been destroyed
                  We can't let this happen as this breaks assumptions
                  elsewhere (e.g. GetNextDlgGroupItem)
                  By returning 0 here, we prevent the default frame handler
                  from messing things up. (one example is a group of radio buttons)

 2002-09-24: Vit Timchishin <tivv@ukr    >
    - KERNEL32: o Fix for OSLibDosFreeMem

 2002-09-24: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - BIN:      o WGSS update from IBM
    - IPHLPAPI: o GetNetworkParams: fixed completely broken code to fill in
                  DNS entries.

 2002-09-19:
    - MAKE, TOOLS/BIN/RM, FASTDEP:
                o IPF and IPP support. They are built in the 'misc' pass.
                  See make\testcase\ipf.mak for usage example.
                  NB. FastDep does only C styled dependency generation
                  for .IPP files.
                o Corrected bad .orc dependency generation.
                o Added some shortcut rules to restart/skip passes.
                o Fixed rm -R filename. Suppressed ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND msgs.

 2002-09-19: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - ODINCRT:  o Include new & delete in memory statistics

 2002-09-19: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Put window on top of owner if owner is not in the foreground;
                  HWND_TOP forces the owner to the top as well
                  (window creation)

 2002-09-18: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o Added code to print leaked heap memory

 2002-09-18: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o WM_MOUSEWHEEL update

 2002-09-17: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Create invisible vertical scroller for all top-level windows
                  so the IBM wheel driver sends us WM_VSCROLL messages
                o Added WM_MOUSEWHEEL message support

 2002-09-16: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - COMCTL32: o LISTVIEW_ProcessLetterKeys bugfix
    - GDI32:    o Statistics fixes & print leaked gdi handles
                  when unloaded.
                o Don't recycle handles too soon. That makes it more difficult
                  to interpret the logfile.

 2002-09-16: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Combobox fix to update selected item when the control is rolled
                  up

 2001-09-15: Dietrich Teickner <Dietrich_Teickner@t-online   >
    - SHELL32:  o Wine resync for shfileop.c

 2002-09-14: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - KERNEL32: o WaitForSingleObject, (Msg)WaitForMultipleObjects:
                  If dwTimeout is not 0 and smaller than 20 ms, then
                  temporarily change thread priority to time critical to
                  make sure we don't get a late timeout.
                  (CLOCKSCALE=4 in config.sys also improves timeout responds)

 2002-09-14: Yuri Dario <mc6530@mclink   >
    - DSOUND:   o Load MMPM2 (MDM.DLL) on demand

 2002-09-12: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Translate PM WM_VSCROLL to WM_MOUSEWHEEL messages (currently
                  only dispatched to (dinput) hook handler)

 2002-09-12: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin   >
    - MAKE:     o Corrected bug in process which made it put the libraries in
                  the wrong place.
                o Always stamp the .def file before linking so that build level
                  info will be up to date.
                o Added some shortcuts rules for lazy programmers:
                  * pass[1-6] for starting from a given pass.
                  * quick for only doing lib, executable and publish.

 2002-09-10: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin   >
    - TOOLS/VSLICK:
                o Added kdev.e. Odin32.e with more goodies like an 'Extra' menu.

 2002-09-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Caret bug in edit control WM_ERASEBKGND handler (hidden,
                  but not shown again)
                o Removed obsolete hack in CreateCaret

 2002-09-05: Dietrich Teickner <Dietrich_Teickner@t-online   >
    - COMDLG32: o Corrected translation of IDS_TODESKTOP resource string

 2002-09-04: knut st. osmundsen <bird@anduin   >
    - FASTDEP:  o Corrected bug in caching. Didn't force rescan of files when
                  a dependant file wasn't present any more.
                o Corrected makefile. No memory debug.
    - CMDQD:    o Corrected makefile.

    - Tools/DailyBuilds:
                o Changed odin32env.cmd to use buildenv.cmd to set up the
                  desired build environment.
                o Changed odin32clean.cmd to use tools\bin\rm.exe.
    - MAKE:     o Corrected CC_NO_DBGMEM check for vac3xx.

 2002-09-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Cleaned up clipboard code

 2002-09-03: Platon Fomichev <platon@innotek   >
    - USER32:   o Fix for Ctrl-Break
