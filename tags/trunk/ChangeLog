 2001-01-23: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o long2ShortName completely broken. now properly detects 8.3
                  filename and copies it (TODO: not finished)
                o Set x position to 0 after seeing a linefeed in the WriteFile
                  datastream (vio console)
                  (Sun Java 1.3 output doesn't include carriage returns)
                o ExitProcess change: make sure no threads are still suspended 
                  (with SuspendThread) by calling ResumeThread
                  OS/2 seems to be unable to terminate the process otherwise.
                  (fixes exitlist zombie after executing the Sun Java 1.3 interpreter)
                o Added handle manager class for standard handles (in/out/error)
                  WriteFile for STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE & STD_ERROR_HANDLE now works.
    - PELDR:    o Don't strip quotes from cmd line parameter part.
                  (fixes Sun Java 1.3 JRE install (must replace 16 bits setup
                   with 32 bits version))
    - INCLUDE\win\thread.h:
                o Wrong layout of TEB structure
                  (fixes crash in Sun Java 1.3 interpreter)

 2001-01-22: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o CreateFileMapping fix; create new handle even when called
                  with name of existing map (and return ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS)
                o _HMHandleGetFree fix; handle allocation wasn't thread safe
                  (_HMHandleGetFree checks if hHMHandle == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE,
                   but calling functions sets this value afterwards -> possible
                   that two threads allocate the same handle)
                  (solution: set hHMHandle in _HMHandleGetFree)
                  HMCreatePipe call also failed because of this. (two handles
                  allocated -> both allocate the same handle)
                o HMCreatePipe change (free 1st handle if 2nd handle alloc fails)
    - DOC\Readme.txt:
                o Added remark about the need to run odininst.exe when installing
                  Odin manually.
                o Updates

 2000-01-21: Przemyslaw Dobrowolski <dobrawka@asua.org.pl>
    - WINMM/MCICDA:
                o Track data fixes

 2001-01-20: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - tools\dailybuild, include\versionos2.h:
                o Fixed netlabs upload.
                o Moved buildlevel info from versionos2.h to odinbuild.h.

 2001-01-20: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - AVIFIL32: o Resynched with latest Wine code
                o Added AVIStreamTimeToSample & AVIStreamSampleToTime stubs
    - SETUPAPI: o Wine port (stubs only)

 2001-01-20: Yuri Dario <mc6530@mclink.it>
    - USER32:   o Set codepage for DCs returned by GetDCEx

 2000-01-20: Przemyslaw Dobrowolski <dobrawka@asua.org.pl>
    - WINMM/MCICDA:
                o MCI_STATUS_POSITION bugfix

 2001-01-19: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o GetCaretPos & SetCaretPos bugfixes. Did not take client
                  window origin into account.
                  (fixes cursor position problems in e.g. Notepad)

 2000-01-19: Przemyslaw Dobrowolski <dobrawka@asua.org.pl>
    - WNASPI32: o DosCreateMutexSem call bugfix.
                  (CDRWIN works again)

 2001-01-19: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   o Added support for kernel revisions. (like 14062A)
                o Added build 14062a kernels.
                o Added build 14062 kernels for Warp 4.

 2001-01-18: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - GDI32:    o More logging
                o Use StretchDIBits in SetDIBitsToDevice instead of Open32
                  function. (which doesn't work for compressed bitmaps)
                  (MS Excel 97 startup bitmap displays correctly now)
                  Also solves y inversion related problems.
                  (MS Developer startup bitmap overlay correct now (Visual C++ logo))
    - WGSS50:   o Reported problems with SaveDC/RestoreDC and StretchDIBits
                  (Modelator graphics corruption fixed)
    - KERNEL32: o Create system.ini with '[mci] cdaudio=mcicda.drv' section
                  during installation
                o Fixed bug in lstrncpyA (return when specified length is 0)
                o MultiByteToWideChar bugfix (calculate string length if input
                  length is -1 before checking if dest length is 0)
                  (MS Word 97 no longer crashes)
                o RegQueryValueExW bugfix
                  (caused stack corruption in Excel and probably many other
                   apps that use this function too)
    - OLEAUT32: o Ported David's typelib changes.
                  (MS Word 97 starts immediately and doesn't spend an hour
                   searching for typelibs in dlls)
                  TODO: Check bugfixes/changes in latest Wine code and merge
                        them.
                  TODO: Port picture classes

 2000-01-17: Przemyslaw Dobrowolski <dobrawka@asua.org.pl>
    - WINMM\MCICDA:
                o Wrong call to os2CDCloseTray

 2001-01-13: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - COMDLG32: o Get current directory if initial dir == NULL (win31 style
                  file dialog).
                o Fix for filter. (default to NULL; not " /0/0")
                o Scale icons to 16x16 (win31 style file dialog) -> system
                  default (32x32) is too big. (TODO: Our user32 icons are too
                  big)
                o Drive list not initialized correctly. (GetDriveTypeA return
                  value interpreted wrong)
                  -> use GetLogicalDrives instead to avoid accessing floppy
                     drives (which GetDriveType does)
    - USER32:   o Replaced some icons with those found in SHELL32:
                  - open & closed folder
                  - floppy, harddisk & network drive
                o Fixed bug in NotifyFormatFrame method (fixes problems
                  with combobox)
                o ComboLBox bugfix (extra vertical scrollbar)
                o LISTBOX_Directory bugfix (must check for FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL)
                  (removes files from directory listing in common file dialog)
    - KERNEL32: o Fix for executable names with spaces in path
                o Workaround for applications that block the PM input queue
                  while waiting for a child process to terminate.
                  (WaitSingleObject now calls MsgWaitMultipleObjects and
                   processes messages while waiting for the process to die)
                  (Napster install now doesn't block PM anymore (forcing a reboot))
                o Add class keys for SHDOCVW during install
    - SHDOCVW:  o Added (Wine 20010112 port)
    - WSOCK32:  o Changed File and Product version to 0x0400, 0x0565012C (NT4, SP6)

 2001-01-12: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - tools\install, tools\dailybuild:
                o Added odincrt.dll to debug release (to make wgss50.dll happy).

 2001-01-11: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o DrawIconEx bugfix (fixes bitmap menu item when maximizing
                  MDI window)
    - COMDLG32: o Added/Ported 16 bits common dialog Wine code.
                  (GetOpen/SaveFileName with hook and without OFN_EXPLORER
                   flag implies old Windows 3.1 style dialog)
                  (not completely working yet, but better than the mess we
                   saw before (InstallShield -> browse dir))

 2001-01-10: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Fix for WriteFile & ReadFile (wrong return code was expected)
    - USER32:   o HAS_THICKFRAME macro changed (identical to Wine now)
                  (fixes MDI window borders (which were too thin))

 2001-01-10: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - tools\install:
                o Corrected packing of wpss50.dll.
                o Added .sym files to release distributions. (optional package)

    - tools\dailybuild:
                o Removed uploading of glide-stuff.

 2001-01-09: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - INCLUDE\dcdata, GDI32, USER32:
                o Updates for WGSS50.

    - LIB\WGSS50.lib, BIN\WGSS50.dll:
                o Binary distribution of WGSS50 added

 2001-01-09: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - tools\dailybuild:
                o Added wgss50.dll to the .ZIPs.

    - lib       o Added making of wgss50.lib.
                  (So, that it corresponds to the other libraries made there.)
                o Converted wgss50.lib to a deffile.

 2001-01-08: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - ReportingBugs.txt:
                o Specify windows & system32 directory in bug reports
                  (description included on how to determine this)

 2001-01-08: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - tools\dailybuild:
                o Updated with temporary server address.
                o Put ftp userid/passwords into separate file.
                o Build number incrementation. (Stored in versionos2.h)
                  (Use bldlevel on the DLLs to look at it.)
                o Splitted out 3dxf/glide stuff into separat .zips.

    - Win32k:   o Added support for the ldrCheckInternalName bug. :-)
                  (see /src/win32k/ldr/myldrCheckInternalName.cpp for details.)
                o Made pe.exe default.
                o Added UNI and SMP 14062 kernels (convenience pack).
                  (Have anyone got the Warp 4 convenience pack with the right .sym files?)

    - bin\bldlevelinf.cmd:
                o Removed colon after otherwise to make it work with Object REXX.

    - makefiles:
                o Merged BuildLevel revisions with the LXOpt revisions.
                  (There seems like there have been some kind of revision mixup in
                   Sanders tree?)
                o Updated the other post files with LXOpt.

 2001-01-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - install:  o Win32k installation temporarily disabled due to a WarpIn bug
                  (config.sys lines removed)
                o Update: This is NOT a WarpIn bug, but an error in the script.
                          Now fixed.
                o Added check for WarpIn 0.9.6 or higher
                o Added check for OS/2 3.x or higher
    - src\makefile:
                o Exclude msvcrt from build process.
                  (download odinapp.zip from ftp.os2.org to install a small
                   MFC app with MFC + MSVCRT dlls)

 2001-01-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - makefiles:o Use LXLite for release build binaries (better compression)
                  Can't use it for debug binaries as IPMD doesn't like it.

 2001-01-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o KERNEL32_99 should return 1 (according to Wine)
                o KERNEL32_100 export added (stub)
    - USER32:   o Rewrote window handle management; only start reusing window
                  handles when max handle has been assigned.
    - GDI32/USER32/KERNEL32:
                o Don't export private Odin functions by name (we import
                  everything by ordinal)

 2001-01-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Menu cast bugfix (bitmap handle is 32 bits)
                  (Fixes menu bitmaps in Lotus Notes 5)
