    - USER32:   o Partial implementation of ToAsciiEx (just calls ToAscii)
                o VkKeyScanExA/W: call VkKeyScanA/W
                o MapVirtualKeyExA/W: call MapVirtualKeyA/W
                o SetParent bugfix; even though the win32 coordinates might 
                  not change, the PM coordinates can. We must make sure the 
                  child stays at the same position (y) relative to the 
                  (new) parent.
                  (Cool Edit Pro LE play buttons now at the right position)
                o Send WM_SETICON to frame window with converted win32 icon
                  (application icon now visible in task list)
                o Quick fix for window creation:
                  Before a window has processed WM_NCCREATE:
                  - GetTopWindow can't return that window handle
                  - GetWindow(parent, GW_CHILD) can't return that window handle
                  - IsChild works
                  TODO: Does this affect more functions?? (other GetWindow ops)
                  (verified in NT4, SP6)
                  TODO: Must add window to parent's child list after WM_NCCREATE
                        and rewrite GetWindow & GetTopWindow
                  (fix for crash in MP3 Explorer)

    - GDI32:    o Workaround for applications that depend on 16 bits
                  GDI object handles.
                  (TODO: must create our own 16 bits handles)
                  (fixes crash in Cool Edit Pro LE)

    - KERNEL32: o Improoved the Unhandled exception message by
                  trying to provide modulename and some kind of obj/offset.
    - FastDep:  o (synced with OS2Tools) Make better use of data in evt.
                   existing .depend file so that only changed files are processed.

 2001-07-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Executable load fix
                  (fixes crash during RealPlayer 8 install)
                o Allow loading of OS/2 dlls for Odin32 apps (like Opera)
    - USER32:   o ToAscii & GetKeyboardState fixes
                  (for Putty keyboard input)
