    - USER32:   o Rewrote window handling. Back to using frame and client windows
                  for each win32 window.
                  (fixes visible region problems with e.g. Opera)
                  Frame windows never have the WS_CLIPCHILDREN style; this caused
                  the transparency problems reported earlier when using this method.
                  E.g.: Dialog parent, groupbox; invalidate part of groupbox -> 
                        painting algorithm stops top-down search when it finds 
                        a window with WS_CLIPCHILDREN style
                        -> result: dialog window won't update groupbox background 
                                   as groupbox only draws the border
                o UpdateWindow: Must use frame window handle even though 
                  UpdateWindow only updates the client area.
                  If the frame window has a valid update region and we call
                  WinUpdateWindow for the client window, then no WM_PAINT 
                  messages will be sent.
                o Don't erase background in RedrawWindow (invalidate) when
                  RDW_ERASE flag not set. 
                  (gets rid of excessive background redraws (flickering) for
                   progress windows in some installers)
                o Fixed ScrollWindow bug
                o WM_SHOWWINDOW sent twice
                o Mark window's visible region as changed when client receives
                  WM_SIZE (PM). BeginPaint sends a WM_ERASEBKGND when this
                  flag is set (regardless of erase flag set by RedrawWindow)
                o ScrollDC fix (window handle transation)
                o ScrollDC and ScrollWindowEx bugfix (setting update region)
                  (fixes scrolling in MS Word 97)
    - GDI32:    o SetDIBitsToDevice: RGB 555 is the default for 16 bits bitmaps
                  (fixes pictures in (some) documents for Word 97)
                  TODO: Probably need to check bitfields and convert for some
                        other blit functions

 2001-05-10: Shingo Tsuda <sofiya@din.or.jp>
    - GDI32:    o Rop conversion for DIB Section blits
                o Support for negative height (origin top left) in
                  SetDIBitsToDevice

 2001-05-10: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - GDI32:    o includeBottomRightPoint bugfix; if left == right or top == bottom
                  then the rectangle isn't empty. (include/include input)
                  (fixes e.g. missing erase background when slowly moving window
                   over Odin window (full window dragging enabled))

    - src/ws2help, bin/debug, bin/release, src/win32k/list,
      src/win32k/debug:
                o Removed directories. These were either not needed
                  or unused. I did this now since I was going to
                  remove ws2help anyway and there by breaking your tree.
    - tools/bin/CVSRemoveDeletedDirs.cmd:
                o Rexx script which removes the above directories
                  from your local tree. Run this from the root of the tree.
                  To physically remove the directories you have to specify
                  REMOVE as argument (no dash or slash!).

 2001-05-08: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - src/makefile:
                o Ignore WS2HELP for the moment.
                  (Never add empty subdirs to /src without making
                   /src/makefile ignore it!)

 2001-05-07: Patrick Haller <patrick.haller@innotek.de>
    - WS2_32:   o created skeleton and added forwarders to WSOCK32
    - KERNEL32: o CreateProcess error handling corrected, if
    		  O32_CreateProcess fails with specific reason

 2001-05-04: Dietrich Teickner <Dietrich_Teickner@t-online.de>
    - SHELL32:  o Update for SHFileOperationA (FO_MOVE)

 2001-05-04: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o FrameTrackFrame bugfix for moving child windows

 2000-05-03: Yuri Dario <mc6530@mclink.it>
    - USER32:   o SendNCCalcSize call bugfix (client rectangle parameter)
                o Fix for groupbox WM_SETFONT handler. Must erase top part
                  if font is changed.
    - OLEAUT32: o Fail for TLBMAGIC2 typelib type.
