 2000-09-04: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - install:  Added Win32kCC.exe and kRx.EXE to the .wpi distributions.

 2000-09-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   WM_PARENTNOTIFY during WM_CREATE was sent to the wrong window
                WM_FOCUSCHANGE fix; set & kill focus was sent twice
                Added more logging.
                Activate window after resizing (WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED in pmwindow.cpp)
    - KERNEL32: Workaround for RegSetValueA; a call to this api in Netscape
                fails with error 8 due to a 0 size of the key data
                HMOpenFile fix; pHMHandleData->dwCreation must be set
                to OPEN_EXISTING or else the memory map class will fail
                to duplicate the handle.

 2000-09-04: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: GetDiskFreeSpaceExA: added support for 64 bits disk size
                Rewrote GetDiskFreeSpace (no longer uses Open32)
    - USER32:   SetWindowLong GWL_WNDPROC changes/fixes
		Type of SetWindowLong determines new window proc type
                UNLESS the new window proc has already been registered
                (use the old type in that case) (VERIFIED in NT 4, SP6)
                Return original window procedure if types match (SetWindowLongX & proc type)
                otherwise window proc wrapper.
                Fixes wrong strings in Notes 5.0. (new string problems, but they
                are caused by something else)
    - COMCTL32: CreateUpDownControl was not exported correctly
                (reported by Reinhold Kopper)

 2000-09-04: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   Improved error reporting.
                Corrected fatal bug in the QueryOptionsStatus IOCtl,
                had forgotten three SSToDS()...

 2000-09-04: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - doc/readme.txt: Updated Win32k sections.
    - Win32k:   Fixed missing object in the 16-bit clib.lib which caused
                linking of win32k.sys to fail in last daily build.
                Support for comport 3 and 4.
    - Win32kCC: Updated dialog to show all information provided by the
                Win32k IOCtl interface.
    - Include/HandleManager.h:
                Added prototype for HMDeviceIoControl which Sander forgot.

 2000-09-03: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
    - KERNEL32: NLS sync with WINE

 2000-09-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: More logging;
                DeviceIoControl didn't have handlemanager wrapper
    - GDI32:    Missing wrapper for WinDrawTabbedText caused FS corruption.
                PLEASE be more careful in the future!

 2000-09-02: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   Finally. I've merged the new changes into the main branch.
                The most important things are:
                    - More correct search order for DLLs. The differences are
                      now that _ALL_ DLLs are found using the Windows search
                      order, and that the LIBPATH are also searched (last).
                    - PE.EXE may be invoked by Win32k.sys.
                      Win32k.sys will now operate in three modes:
                        - Pe2Lx mode. Only the Pe2Lx method is used.
                        - Mixed Pe2Lx and Pe.exe mode. Pe.exe is invoked for
                          executables which Pe2Lx don't currently support.
                          (like WinWord, which BTW may trap you PC if invoked
                          in Pe2Lx mode.)
                          This is the default mode.
                        - Pe.exe mode. Pe.exe is allways used.
                      (see readme.txt, I'll update it to ASAP but not to night.
                       (I tired after working 36 hours on finishing this...)
                    - UNIX Shell Scripts are working (now).
                    - JAVA invokation. If you try to load a JAVA class the
                      it is executed using java.exe. (note that the class
                      name is case sensitive!)
                    - Pure REXX. This one is for Nenad. .RX and .REX are
                      loaded using a tiny REXX starter, kRX.exe (found in
                      System32 directory).
                    - Win32k Control Center, Win32kCC.EXE. Simple PM
                      program which allows you to change the Win32k.SYS
                      options while running. It does also show some status
                      information (will be extended).
                    - Support for FP14 in the Symbol database.
                      (use the 09th Aug. kernel please).

    - KERNEL32: Speeded up loading by using Win32k.sys IOCtl to get
                objecttable entries (OTE) for the Pe2Lx executable images,
                instead of using DosQuerySysState (which gets OTEs for all
                modules in the entrie system). (This is the reason for the
                win32k.lib file - it's made by the 'libs' rule from src.)

 2000-09-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   Rewrote IsZoomed
                Removed winzip invisible button fix; causes many repaint
                problems. Need to find the real cause.
    - DDRAW:    More debug logging; implemented ClipGetClipList
    - WINMM:    mixerGetID fix (for NULL hmixer)

 2000-09-01: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - INCLUDE:  Shut up the OS/2 resource compiler (added -n to OS2RCFLAGS).
                Added linkage macro for the OS2RC which exepacks the resource
                object: OS2RCLFLAGS

 2000-09-01: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
    - GDI32:  - Open32 fix for CreateDIBitmap: some apps claim they have
                a bitmap w/o palette color table and then send one in to copy.
    - USER32: - PMWINDOW.CPP: WM_FOCUSCHANCE - validate GetTopParent() handle
