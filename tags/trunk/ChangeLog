    - KERNEL32: Don't translate values returned by WaitForSingleObject.
                Open32's WaitForSingleObject returns the correct values.
                -> breaks a lot of things including RealPlayer 7
                (removed bugfix 2000-07-17: fixed return codes for HMWaitForSingleObject)
    - DOC\ToDo.txt:
                Added:

    - KERNEL32: Include message in log entry if FS != 0x150b (doesn't always
                means FS is trashed though)
   
 2000-07-21: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - SHLWAPI:  SHGetSpecialFolderPathA: StartMenu changed in 'Start Menu'
                (now identical to Windows 98/NT)

                Fixed FS corruption in CreateCaret
                Fixed positioning of caret (needed due to client/frame -> frame window changes)

                Always try to allocate an executable image at it's preferred address 
                (even if it has fixups)

 2000-07-19: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - INCLUDE\makefiles
      SRC\*\makefile
      ODINCRT
                Build different odincrt for debug & release build (odincrtd & odincrt)
                Odin dlls now link with correct version
    - GDI32:    Wrapper rewrite for region apis
                Changed export for user32 (uses stdcall calling convention now

                Compilation fixes for Opera
    - USER32:   Extra logging information
                Fixed sending WM_PARENTNOTIFY in ::DestroyWindow

 2000-07-18: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - WINMM:    If waveOutSetVolume called with NULL waveout handle, use
                that volume as the default for newly created streams.
                (fixes volume in RealPlayer 7)
    - KERNEL32: Fixed old unload order bug (causes a crash when quitting 
                RealPlayer 7); increase dynamic library count after calling
                dll entrypoint with DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH. (used to be before;
                -> wrong unload order of RPAP3260 & PNRS3260)
                Call dll entrypoint with DLL_PROCESS_DETACH even when
                thread library calls disabled.

 2000-07-18: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - KERNEL32: APIs are to be placed should have ordinal less than 1200
                - even if they don't belong in the dll but just happend to be
                implemented there. The reason is for humans and for
                documentation tools to be able to tell which exports are APIs
                and which are internal Odin32 function/APIs.
    - div:      Added some missing $Id keywords.
    - database: Trying to make the database more useful. Extracting more
                data from the source files.
                According to the doc\ToDo file we're to write structured
                and well documented code. This database is indetended to
                make the documentation (++) browsable. (PHP)

 2000-07-17: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
    - KERNEL32: fixed ReadFile/WriteFile bugfix
                fixed return codes for HMWaitForSingleObject

 2000-07-16: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   Created a development branch called "Grace" and checked my
                current code in into it. (This is the reason why there are
                some new files in the src/win32k tree.)

 2000-07-15: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   XWing vs Tie Fighter fix broke RealPlayer 7 setup (missing buttons)
                -> rewrote RDW_INVALIDATE code in RedrawWindow to work for
                both applications
    - KERNEL32: Added extra check in isPEImage method
                lpNumberOfBytesRead/Written can be NULL in Read/WriteFile
    - PELDR:    Fix for arguments with quotes (first and last quote removed)
                (i.e. pe rnuninst "RealNetworks|RealPlayer|6.0| -i -p")
                Fix for exe name with dir containing spaces

 2000-07-12: Przemyslaw Dobrowolski <dobrawka@asua.org.pl>
    - KERNEL32: Implemented handlemanager support for named and unnamed pipes

 2000-07-10: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: Don't try to search for resources if the module doesn't contain any

 2000-07-09: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
    - doc:      Moved several documents to the new doc directory and
                created initial version of "ToDo.txt". We should place
                our open tasks in there for better overview and to be able
                to assign priorities and people to them.

 2000-07-07: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - NTDLL:    Bugfix for NtQueryInformationToken (TOKEN_USER); updated
                with latest Wine code (TODO: NTDLL needs to be resynced)

 2000-07-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: Store user default language in thread database struct
                Set/GetThreadLocale change/return this LCID value
                Fixed EnumSystemLocalesA/W; now returns default user language id
                (in text) (TODO: should return all supported locales)
    - KERNEL32/GDI32/USER32: Changed/fixed calls to strncpy (for 0 termination)

 2000-07-06: Vitali E. Pelenyov <Vitali.Pelenyov@dpt.ustu.ru>
    - ODINCRT:  Fixed wrong implementation of strncpy; do not 0 terminate
                string unless length < length parameter
                (this is correct behaviour according to C library manual)

 2000-07-04: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: Unstubbed CopyFileExA/W (calls CopyFileA/W; not properly implemented)
                Unstubbed CreateDirectoryExA/W (calls CreateDirectoryA/W; not properly implemented)
                Fixed GetShortPathNameA/W; don't touch short path parameter if
                it's NULL; behaviour (as seen in NT 4, SP6):
                - converts long filename to 8.3 short filname (TODO: not yet done here!)
                - fails on volume that doesn't support 8.3 filenames
                - if lpszShortPath 0 or cchBuffer too small -> return required length
                  (INCLUDING 0 terminator)
                - if lpszLongPath == NULL -> ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER (return 0)
                - if lpszLongPath empty -> proceed as if nothing is wrong
                  (Wine claims it sets last error to ERROR_BAD_PATHNAME)
                - does NOT clear the last error if successful!
                - if successful -> return length of string (excluding 0 terminator)
    - USER32:   Fixed adding windows to tasklist (done too late)
    - GDI32/USER32:
                - Rewrote Set/GetViewportExtEx, Set/GetMapMode & moved them
                  from gdi32 to user32

 2000-07-03: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - KERNEL32: Added IsDebuggerPresent (debug.cpp). Returns FALSE, but by
                SETing ODIN32.DEBUGGERPRESENT=1 it will return TRUE. (Some
                application might issue calls to OutputDebugString if they
                think they're being debugged.)
                Moved OutputDebugString(A/W) to debug.cpp.

 2000-07-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - RICHED32: Fixed bug when creating edit window (needs to be WS_CHILD)
    - USER32:   Fixed moving of child windows in MsgFormatFrame & move
                child windows if only client rectangle changes
                (fixes Acrobat Distiller window)
    - SHELL32:  Put back check for registration of ShellView window class
                -> RegisterClass now fails if already registered
                (fixed openfile dialogs)
