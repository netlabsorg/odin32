Project Odin Software License

You may, without charge, royalty, or other payment, copy and
distribute copies of this work and derivative works of this work
in source or binary form provided that:
(1) you appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice; (2) faithfully reproduce all prior copyright
included in the original work; and (3) agree to indemnify and
hold all prior authors, copyright holders and licensors of the
work harmless from and against all damages arising from use of
or the inability to use the work.

You may distribute binaries and sources of derivative works of
the work provided that: (1) all modifications to the original
source code are publically available; (2) all modifications are
released under this license; (3) all copyrights of the original
work are included; (4) the modifications are a direct advantage
for the functionality and completeness of the product or improve
interoperability of the product with another product and do not
interfere with the goal of an open source and free emulation
product.

You may NOT use the work as base of another work that is
not released under this license agreement meaning that you
especially are not allowed to develop any other product which
is based on the sources and/or binaries of the work.

However, you are encouraged to use the work for porting your
free or commercial applications. You can ship software
converted using the work as long as the original copyright
for the work is mentioned and you do not charge for
using any part of the work. You may also ship the work in
binaries and sources for use with your applications as long
as you do not violate the distribution regulations of this license.

These license terms can be amended by a custom license
agreement between a third party and the administration
team. Such a custom license might only limit the above terms
if the changes cause a direct advantage for the functionality
or completeness of the product and do not interfere with the
goal of an open-source and free emulation product.

Parts of the work may be governed by a license other than
this one, if the source directory of the part contains a
license file called "LICENSE.TXT" of its own. If a different
license exists, it supercedes this license. Removing the
the part specific license will automatically put back the
part under the terms of this license. Only the Odin management
team is allowed to put parts of the work under a different
license and remove the part specific licenses. The purpose
of using different licenses is solely for allowing code
sharing of certain parts of the work with other projects that
have incompatible licenses. These parts should either have
this license in a version that makes it compatible with the
license of the second project, or the license of the second
project as long as it conforms to the goals of an open source
and free emulation software.
