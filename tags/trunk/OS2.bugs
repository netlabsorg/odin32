OS/2 bugs:
- Dlls are terminated in the order in which they're present in the modules
  name lookup table instead of taking dependencies into account

- DosSetMem doesn't seem to do what it's supposed to;
  the size parameter has to be adjusted to take page boundary crossing
  into account. According to the Control Program Programming Guide, DosSetMem 
  should do this automatically.
