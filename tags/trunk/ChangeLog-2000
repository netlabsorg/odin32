 2000-04-30: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
        - ODINWRAP: added profiling support. The odin wrapper macros now
                    can measure function calls, this is the cumulative
                    method call time with 838ns accuracy (tick unit).

 2000-04-30: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- KERNEL32: LocalFlags fix (low byte = lock count, hight byte (of low word) = memory flags)
                    LocalGetFlags, LocalLock & LocalUnlock now check if the
                    pointer is larger than 3 GB. Some apps calls these functions
                    with GDI object handles.
	- OLEAUT32: Don't create logfiles in release build

 2000-04-29: Yuri Dario <mc6530@mclink.it>
	- USER32:   Bugfix for owner of windows (set to owner instead of parent now)

 2000-04-29: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- USER32/KERNEL32: Added selectable logging for level 2 dprintfs.

	- USER32:   Commented out default x & y position code
                    (FCF_SHELLPOSITION no longer works)
                    -> fixes menu & toolbars in MS Word 97

	- KERNEL32: Added windows directory override again
                    (NOTE: for developers *ONLY*; DO NOT USE IT)
                    [DEVDIRECTORIES]
                    WINDOWS=drive:\path
                    Default System directory is kernel32 path
                    (with new install program: x:\odin\system32)
                    Default Windows directory is parent of System Directory
                    (with new install program: x:\odin)
		    NOTE: This assumption could break current installs
                          Will be fixed in upcoming WarpIn installation distributions

                    Changed InitSystemAndRegistry:
  		    InitSystemAndRegistry creates:
			- WINDOWSDIR\SYSTEM
		        - WINDOWSDIR\AppData
		        - WINDOWSDIR\Cache
		        - WINDOWSDIR\Cookies
		 	- WINDOWSDIR\Desktop
		 	- WINDOWSDIR\Favorites
		 	- WINDOWSDIR\Fonts
		        - WINDOWSDIR\History
		 	- WINDOWSDIR\NetHood
		 	- WINDOWSDIR\My Documents
		 	- WINDOWSDIR\PrintHood
		 	- WINDOWSDIR\Recent
		 	- WINDOWSDIR\SendTo
		 	- WINDOWSDIR\Start Menu
		 	- WINDOWSDIR\Start Menu\Programs
		 	- WINDOWSDIR\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
		 	- WINDOWSDIR\ShellNew
		 	- and a minimal system registry

	- TOOLS\INSTALL: WarpIn install script + small install program
                         that calls kernel32 export (InitSystemAndRegistry)

	- TOOLS\WRC:     Forgot to add change in preproc.c (ifdef)
                         (shouldn't really matter though)

 2000-04-27: David Raison <djr@lemur.co.uk>
        - OLE32/NEW: Work-in-progress on adding apartment handling.
	  Added here for backup until ready for release.

 2000-04-27: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
        - tools/DailyBuild: Checked in the scripts used for the daily build.

 2000-04-27: Achim Hasenmueller <achimha@innotek.de>
	- put back new wrc.exe, provide workarounds in
	  header files, old one breaks comdlg32
	  TODO: find bug in new wrc and really fix it

 2000-04-26: David Raison <djr@lemur.co.uk>
        - INCLUDE/WIN: Added RPC_E_* codes to winerror.h
        - OLE32: Fixed StringFromGUID2

 2000-04-25: Achim Hasenmueller <achimha@innotek.de>
	- TOOLS/BIN: put back old wrc.exe from Oct. 99 because the
	             new one has problems with include files...

 2000-04-25: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
        - SHLWAPI: - stubbed all the UrlXXX functions (required for IE4/5 ;-)

 2000-04-23: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- GDI32:   Dib section blit fix (missing pixels)
	- WSOCK32: Don't send FD_CLOSE message when select returns
                   and there's no data available (recv in another thread
                   might have taken that data before the ioctl call in
                   the WSAAsyncSelect thread is executed)
                   -> fixes lost connections in RealPlayer 7

 2000-04-19: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
        - INCLUDE/PDWIN32.TOOLS: fix build rule for (old) .asm sources

 2000-04-19: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@pmsc.no>
        - KERNEL32: Added fix for bug in FP13 DosQuerySysInfo.
                Win32k/Pe2Lx loaded files didn't work.
                Corrected TLS handling for Borland.

 2000-04-19: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- TOOLS\WRC: Resync with latest Wine wrc + added code to produce
                     masm compatible assembly (for some reason removed from
                     wrc some time ago)
                     -> fixes file open dialog (nothing painted)
	- COMCTL32:  Check for NULL pointers before freeing memory
                     (toolbar; removes some warnings from the logfiles)

 2000-04-18: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- USER32:   Added LR_LOADFROMFILE support for icon & cursor loading
	- GDI32:    Dib section fixes (use height/width of window when
                    dc belongs to a window; use correct stretchblit mode)
	- TOOLS\REGEDIT: Added regedit command line tool (ported this from
                         Wine with some modifications & bug fixes)
	- KERNEL32: Also set FPU control word to 0x27f before calling thread
                    functions (just to be sure)

 2000-04-16: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
	- COMCTL32: added new resources: i.e. header cursors
		    changed file version to 5.80 (IE5, Win2k)
		    implemented missing listview messages, implemented some
		    extended styles

 2000-04-16: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- KERNEL32: Put back dll search method, fixed bug in LoadLibraryEx
                    (no return after error detection)
                    Set FPU control word to 0x27F before calling exe entrypoint
                    (fixes some FPU exception problems in RealPlayer 7)

 2000-04-16: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@pmsc.no>
        - KERNEL32: Reorganized/reworte LoadLibrary/LoadLibraryEx code.
                    isPEImage was changed to return 1 if DLL and 2 if EXE.
                    (It still returns FALSE if not valid PE image.)

        - include\odin32validate.h:
                    New header file. Parameter validation macros.
        - KERNEL32: Before reading Sanders last message I had rewritten most of
                    the findDll function. So, as my implementation seems a bit
                    more flexible I decided to commit it.
                    Currently it's searching the three LIBPATH paths too. If
                    this causes any real trouble we'll disable this.

                    findDll now returns TRUE if a file were found. Callers are
                    corrected to test for this.

 2000-04-15: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
        - COMCTL32: rewrote listview item handling: sort bug fix,
                    allows >= 4.70 support
                    implemented several new messages

 2000-04-15: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - WSOCK32:  Async select fix (VPBuddy can connect again)
        - KERNEL32: Remove terminating backslash in FindFirstFileA (if present)
                    (otherwise DosFindFirst fails)
                    Fixed flushing of file maps (wrong VirtualQuery parameter)
                    Path search fix for dlls
                    Dll search order:
                    1) exe dir
                    2) current dir
                    3) windows system dir (kernel32 path)
                    4) windows dir
                    5) path environment variable

        - ODINCRT:  Added checks for failing mallocs
        - USER32:   Corrected return value of EnableWindow
                    Send WM_CANCELMODE message when disabling window
                    (return true if previous state was disabled, else false (sdk docs))
                    Don't send mouse messages to disabled windows; reroute
                    them to their parent windows (if any)

 2000-04-14: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - KERNEL32: Hardcoded system & windows dir
                    system dir  = kernel32 dir
                    windows dir = kernel32 dir\win
                    Fixed dll attach for pe2lx/win32k & lx Odin executables
                    Command line fixes (now starts with full path of exe)
                    Search for dlls in:
                    1) current dir
                    2) win32 exe dir
                    3) windows system dir
                    4) path
                    Append backslash if GetFileAttributes fails (and it's missing
                    from the filename)
        - PELDR/KERNEL32: Fixed starting of executable with spaces in name
                          (might not be 100% complete yet)
                          Fixes for relative path of executable
        - ODIN.INI.TXT: Removed DIRECTORIES section

 2000-04-13: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32: Set thread message structure to 0 before dispatching it
                  Prevents app from sending the same posted message twice
                  (causing problems when freeing the postmsg struct)
                  (fixes RealPlayer 7 Update service)
        - CRTDLL: Fixed div (result must be returned in edx:eax)
        - PE:     Check PATH for executable file

 2000-04-12: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
        - COMCTL32: listview: completed most version 4 features

 2000-04-10: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32: Added support for topmost windows

 2000-04-10: David Raison <djr@lemur.co.uk>
        - COMDLG32: fixed wrong lParam in file dialog

 2000-04-09: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - GDI32: Y inversion fix for dib sections blits
        - WINMM: GetPosition fix (don't return 0 when stream not active)
        - KERNEL32: Fixed OSLibDosFindFirst. Return error if First DosFirstFirst
                    fails. (fixes RealPlayer 7 install)

 2000-04-09: Yuri Dario <mc6530@mclink.it>
        - INCLUDE(\WIN):
                - odin.h: define NONAMELESSUNION only for VA3.0 (now works with VA4);
                          remove buildin.h when invoked from resource compiler.
                - commctrl.h: new macros
                - mmsystem.h: define DUMMYUNIONNAME with same code used in other
                              headers to avoid precompiling errors.
                - shlguid.h: missing ID
                - shlobj.h: missing shlguid.h include
                - windows.h: define CINTERFACE only for C compilers or VA3.x
                - windowsx.h: macros
                - wingdi.h: few AW defines
                - winuser.h: new macros

 2000-04-08: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
        - COMCTL32: added new styles and functionality, bug fixes

 2000-04-08: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - WINMM:    Restart, pause & underrun fixes
        - KERNEL32: Fixed bug in CompareStringW. Unicode conversion was
                    causing heap corruption. (RealPlayer 7 crashes)

 2000-04-07: Michal Necasek <mike@mendelu.cz>
        - DDRAW\NEW: Experimental fullscreen DDraw, VIDEOPMI based.
             May not work with all video cards and may cause all
             kinds of trouble. But works swell for eg. Fallout 1/2
             or HMM3. Contains some extra bugs compared to the
             windowed DDraw, ie. Moorhuhn and others don't work
             with it at all. Please tell me about your experience
             with this shameless hack.

 2000-04-07: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - WINMM:  Don't restart when already playing
        - USER32: Print mark in debug log with WriteLog (#ifdef DEBUG), not dprintf
                  Workaround for paint problems in RealPlayer 7 Update 1.
                  (don't clip the dc with a region in DoNCPaint if the clip
                   region has the same size as the window; doing so creates
                   update problems for no obvious reason)
        - GDI32:  Only change bitmap size in SetDIBitsToDevice if bitmap
                  is not compressed. (fixes crash during startup in Excel)
                  NOTE: Open32 doesn't implement compression type conversion
                        correctly. (black splash screen for RLE8 bitmap)
        - KERNEL32: Return length of windows or system directory when
                    GetWindowsDirectory/GetSystemDirectory is called with
                    a NULL pointer

 2000-04-07: David Raison <djr@lemur.co.uk>
        - USER32: Set lfSmCaptionFont structure in NONCLIENTMETRICSA
                  (SystemParametersInfoA/SPI_GETNONCLIENTMETRICS)

 2000-04-07: Knut St. Osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@pmsc.no>
        - TOOLS\DBGINFO: Sym2Hll is now able to convert .SYM files into HLL
                debuginfo and add it to LX executables. This might be
                quite useful if you want to see system DLL while debugging.
                But before you add debuginfo to all dll's in c:\os2\dll
                I have to warn that this is _very_ alpha software. Do always
                make a backup (Sym2Hll don't create backups!) and have
                recovery boot disks ready!

 2000-04-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - WINMM: Fixed message callback once more (previous fix broke rp7)
                 Fixed restart

 2000-04-08: Michal Necasek <mike@mendelu.cz>
        - WINMM: Moved phwo == NULL check below format query handling.
                 (enables sound in Jack Jazzrabbit; still not right though)

 2000-04-05: David Raison <djr@lemur.co.uk>
        - OLEAUT32: Turned default DEBUG-info down.

 2000-04-05: Knut St. Osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@pmsc.no>
        - Win32k: Added fixpack 13 symbols to the symbol database.
                  Using win32k.sys with fp13 works fine here.

 2000-04-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - WINMM: Smallest waveout buffer size = 128 bytes
                 Fixed callback bugs (reported by Michal Necasek)

 2000-04-03: David Raison <djr@lemur.co.uk>
        - OLE32: Added CoCreateGUID (calls RPCRT4.UuidCreate)
        - RPCRT4: Beginning of new dll:
            RpcStringFreeA, RpcStringFreeW, UuidCompare
            UuidCreate, UuidCreateNil, UuidEqual
            UuidFromStringA, UuidFromStringW, UuidHash
            UuidIsNil, UuidToStringA, UuidToStringW

 2000-04-02: Przemyslaw Dobrowolski <dobrawka@asua.org.pl>
        - SHELL32: don't sort files case sensitive

 2000-04-02: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
        - KERNEL32: FindFirst: don't return "." and ".." in root
                    wrote long to short name conversion
                    added error code converter
        - USER32: removed 'What You See Is What You Get On First Of April'

 2000-04-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32: dc.cpp cleanup
        - GDI32:  Dib section sync bugfix (todo: rgb 565 to 555 conversion if bpp == 16)
                  Set y inversion to 0 if dib section isn't flipped
                  (fixes upside down flash videos in RealPlayer 7)
        - WINMM:  Faked mixer apis

 2000-04-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - GDI32: Fixed dibsection bitblits. (wrong updates of realplayer 7
                 videos)

 2000-04-01: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
        - USER32: added WYSIWYGOFOA interface

 2000-04-01: Edgar Buerkle <Edgar.Buerkle@gmx.net>
        - USER32: Fixed track frame width & height (now you can actually
                  see the tracking frame when moving a window)

 2000-03-31: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
	- USER32: readded CS_HITTEST for HT_TRANSPARENT handling, transparent
		  tooltips are now supported
		  (why is HT_TRANSPARENT in the groupbox control commented out?)
	- COMCTL32: treeview: added TTF_TRANSPARENT tooltip style

 2000-03-30: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
	- KERNEL32:
	- SHLWAPI: added stubs for explorer.exe
	- COMCTL32: treeview: finished info tip

 2000-03-30: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- KERNEL32: Also double thread stack in release build
                    (RealPlayer 7 runs out of stack sometimes)
	- WSOCK32:  Fixed bugs in WSAStartup/Cleanup & select (fixes Gnutella)

 2000-03-29: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- KERNEL32: Throw exception when critical section times out
	- USER32:   Fixed bugs in PeekMessageA/W (fixes connection failures
                    & hangs after warning dialogs in RealPlayer 7)
	- GDI32:    Check for NULL region in GetRgnBox; can cause a crash
                    in Open32

 2000-03-29: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
	- KERNEL32: added FindFileFirstMultiA for internal usage

 2000-03-28: Markus Montkowski <mmontkowski@gmx.de>
        - KERNEL32: Added workaround for GetDiskFreeSpaceA; Open32 api doesn't
                    like NULL pointers

 2000-03-28: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- KERNEL32: Fixed VirtualQuery; cbLength is length of memory structure,
                    not range of pages
                    Fixed compare of imported api names with length < 4
                    Fixed OpenFile; if filename doesn't contain path, look for
                    it in:
		    1: dir from which the app loaded
                    2: current dir
                    3: windows system dir
                    4: windows dir
                    5: dirs in path path environment variable
          NOTE: Icon extraction in shell32 is broken; expects PE
                images even when looking for icons in shell32.
                (it should use FindResourceExA/W when looking for resources
                 in that case)

	- GDI32:    Default format of 16 bits dibsection is RGB555
                    (fixes wrong colors when (sometimes) playing flash files
                     in RealPlayer 7)
	- WSOCK32\NEW: Bugfixes
        - WSOCK32:  Replaced with new wsock32

 2000-03-24: Achim Hasenmueller <achimha@innotek.de>

	               header files.
                       NOTE: should we rely on the 32bit
	                     stack, is there any benefit for us?
	- DPLAY: Added ordinals 2 and 3 to the def file, APIs
	         already seem to be implemented?!?

                               been loaded!
                     Replaced WriteLogs by dprintfs

 2000-03-21: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- GDI32: Added RGB 555 to 565 conversion in dibsection blit.
                 (fixes wrong colors in RealPlayer 7 Update 1 (rm videos
                  only))
	- include\odinwrap.h: Disable heap checking by default for debug
                              build -> kills performance!

 2000-03-17: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - WSOCK32: Semaphore protection for relay slot alloc/free
                   Fixed bug in WSAAsyncSelect.  Allow more than one
                   async call per window for RelayAlloc call. If it's not
                   alloced, pmwsock will return an error. Previously it was
                   overwriting slots for other async calls. (WSAAsyncGetHostName
                   in RealPlayer 7)
        - KERNEL32: Fixed handle creation for thread 0.

 2000-03-16: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundse@pmsc.no>
    - TOOLS\FASTDEP:
            Speed optimizations: using AVL trees, include dir caching,
                dependencies stored in AVL tree until all files has been
                processes, buffered write.
            Cyclic dependency check.
            All files but the objectfiles now should have fully qualified paths.

    - INCLUDE\PDWIN32.TOOLS:
            DEPEND: Enabled cyclic check.

 2000-03-16: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32: Fixed virtual keycode of return key
                  TODO: Not done for all keys. Should probably looks at the
                        scancode (not virtual char) to translate keys.
        - GDI32:  RP7 calls CreateDIBSection with HDC 0; Call
                  GetWindowDC(GetDesktopWindow()) in that case
                  -> fixes crash (result of CreateDIBSection failure)
                  TODO: Looks like this is allowed in NT, but need to check
                        this to be sure nothing else caused this problem.
                  (Note: most recent RealPlayer 7 version only)
        - KERNEL32: Semaphore protection of handle alloc
                    Added handlemanager class for thread handles
                    Added workaround for Open32 WaitForSingleObject bug
                    (if thread is terminated and WaitForSingleObject is
                     called with the thread's handle -> never returns
                     (new rp7 hang at exit))
                    TODO: WaitForMultipleObjects can still hang ->
                          Event, semaphore, mutex & wait apis need to
                          be redesigned (not using Open32)

 2000-03-14: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
        - USER32: implemented much faster LB_SETCOUNT

 2000-03-12: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32: Put back check (oldsel == newsel) in LISTBOX_SetSelection
                  (why was this commented out?)
                  Fixed combobox: Clear CBF_SELCHANGE flag before calling
                                  CBUpdateEdit
                                  Don't send CBN_EDITUPDATE when CBF_NOEDITNOTIFY
                                  flag is set (by combo_handletext)
                  -> fixes infinite loops in RealPlayer 7 (type name of file
                     previously used in edit box; last letter entered -> crash)
                  AdjustWindowRectEx bugfix (reported by Robert Lalla)
                  Don't clear WS_POPUP flag. (HAS_THINFRAME depends on it)
                  -> fixes wrong resolution changes in Quake 2
                  Don't clear WS_CHILD flag either. (HAS_THICKFRAME depends on it)

        - KERNEL32: Clear FILE_SHARE_DELETE flag before calling Open32's
                    CreateFile. (otherwise it fails) -> fixes RealPlayer 7
                    Basic (new update).

        - WSOCK32: Changed workaround for setsockopt bug (SO_SNDBUF/SO_RCVBUF (OS/2's
                   winsock returns WSAEINVAL if size > 64k))
                   Only change size if setsockopt returns WSAINVAL (32 bits stack
                   should support size > 64 kb (?))
                   Added selective logging feature.

 2000-03-12: Markus Montkowski <mmontkowski@gmx.de>
        - KERNEL32: Added fix for GetFileAttributes. Open32 doesn't like
                    i.e. 'c:'; needs to be changed into 'c:\'

 2000-03-12: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - include\winconst.h: Fixed KEY_ALL_ACCESS definition
                              (reported by Yuri Dario)
        - DSOUND: Replaced dsound by new version
        - USER32: Replaced os2.h includes by os2wrap.h
                  Set message nr, wParam & lParam to 0 for dummy messages
                  (to prevent keyboard or mouse messages swallowed by dinput
                   from being dispatched)
        - KERNEL32: Replaced os2.h includes by os2wrap.h (cvtcursorgrp & oslibdebug)
        - WSOCK32: Fixed bug in setsockopt for SO_SNDBUF/SO_RCVBUF (OS/2's
                   winsock returns WSAEINVAL if size > 64k)

 2000-03-12: Michal Necasek <mike@mendelu.cz>
        - dsound\new: Fixed sound in Heroes of M&M III

 2000-03-11: Przemyslaw Dobrowolski <dobrawka@asua.org.pl>
        - OPENGL\GLIDE: Fix for Voodoo 1 glide (missing io ports)

 2000-03-11: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundse@pmsc.no>
        - OPENGL\GLUT: Fix for gettimeofday. This is defined conflicting in
                the toolkit sys\time.h.
        - TOOLS\BIN: Implemented an optional directory locking in
                dowithdirs.cmd. (Useful for SMP builds.)

 2000-03-11: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - OPENGL\GLUT: Fixed compile problems + cleanup
                       (use C(XX)FLAGS_WIN32APP so you don't have to
                        explicitely specify which api type you use (ascii or unicode)!)

        - OPENGL\GLIDE: Fixed wrong binary path for voodoo1 glide
        - include\win\debugtools.h: Disable TRACE, WARN etc when DEBUG is not defined

 2000-03-11: Jeroen van den Horn <J.vandenHorn@fibre.a2000.nl>
        - OPENGL: Fixed error preventing build to complete

 2000-03-09: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - KERNEL32: Set initial max nr of file handles to 256 during kernel32 init
                    Create DDRAW & DSOUND registry keys in InitRegistry
                    (NOTE: Must be done in install program!)
                    Added some win95 stubs
        - GDI32:    Added 16 bits device apis stubs

 2000-03-10: Michal Necasek <mike@mendelu.cz>
        - dsound\new: Changed DART buffer size calcualation, hopefully
                      WinAmp will sound better now.

 2000-03-09: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundse@pmsc.no>
        - include\pdwin32.tools: New tool, EXISTS --> \tools\bin\Exists.cmd
        - tools\bin\Exists.cmd: New tool which checks if the file passed in
                exists. If the file exists it returns 0, else 1. This is
                used to check if .depend and other files exists in the
                makefiles. (See pdwin32.post to see how.)
        - include\pdwin32.post: .depend is only included if it exists. You'll
                get a warning if it don't, but the makefile works fine.
                Added a check on OBJDIR not being empty in the clean rule.
                $(RM) $(OBJDIR)\* is will remove all files in the root dir if
                OBJDIR is empty.
        - win32k: Updated makefile with the use of EXISTS for both .depend and
                makfile.inc. An update check for makefile.inc <-> configure.cmd
                was also added.
                Added checks for empty variables in clean rule, and we no longer
                deletes * in any directory.

        A CVS tip:
            When new directories are added you have to to a 'cvs checkout .'
            from the root.
            A 'cvs update' don't get the new directories it seems
        (There have been added some dirs under win32k lately so please do this.)

 2000-03-09: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - KERNEL32: Major rewrite of PE loader classes to correctly support
                    dll dependencies
                    TODO: Circular dependencies only partly working
                          (a->b->a works, but a->b->c->a doesn't)
        - USER32: Fixed bug in dialog constructor (class name translation)
                  (only showed up in release build)
                  Dinput mouse changes/fixes

 2000-03-08: Michal Necasek <mike@mendelu.cz>
        - dsound\new: Fixed volume and panning calculation that
                      sometimes caused ugly noise

 2000-03-08: Michal Necasek <mike@mendelu.cz>
        - dsound\new: Completely new DART-based DirectSound. Works fine
                      for me with Quake 3, Moorhuhn and WinAmp.

 2000-03-07: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundse@pmsc.no>
        - makefiles and include\pdwin32.*:
            * Updated nearly all makefiles to the new makefile style.
              Win32k, pe2lx and some subdirs of Winmm
            * Odin32 resource files are now to have the extention .orc
              All files have, save some under WinMM and in old/new dirs,
              been renamed. There are now new interference rules in
              pdwin32.tools which will create the resource assembly and
              assemble it into an object file. So you simply have to
              specify the output object file for Odin32 resources along
              with the other object files.
            * A little not on forwarders. ILINK returns a warning code of
              4 when aliases are generated. An errorcode <> 0 stops NMAKE
              normally. To workaround these problem we simply tell NMAKE to
              accespt all error codes in the range 0-4. This is done by
              putting '-4 ' in front of the $(LD2) statement.
              I don't want to see _any_ '-$(LD2)'!!!


 2000-03-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32: Fixed bug in edit control
                  If nyoff > nr lines in control -> bottom line in control
                  window should show last line of control
                  Wine code shows last line at the top of the control
                  (Quake 3 startup edit control shows the problem)

 2000-03-05: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundse@pmsc.no>
        - include\pdwin32.vac*: Added OS2RC and OS2RCFLAGS. This defines the
                OS/2 resource compiler and the flags used during compilation.
                When it comes to linking we should assume NO flags and simply
                invoke the it like this: $(OS2RC) <source>.res <target>.dll.
                (See src\kernel32\makefile for an example.)

 2000-03-05: Jeroen van den Horn <J.vandenHorn@fibre.a2000.nl>
        - GLUT32: Really fixed optimized build now. Was not a VACPP bug but
                  error in calling convention prototype in glutint.h

 2000-03-04: Jeroen van den Horn <J.vandenHorn@fibre.a2000.nl>
        - GLUT32: Added logic to escape from optimizer bug in VACPP

 2000-03-04: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundse@pmsc.no>
        - fastdep: Simple preprocessor. Commments and #if 0/1.
        - OPENGL: Corrected makefiles. using LD2 and LD2FLAGS. Many makefiles
                 Didn't concider the NODEBUGINFO macro causing daily builds
                 to become enormous. Daily build of 6MB is not good!.
        - include\pdwin32.v*.*:
                *Alternate linker tool, LD2. This is ilink for VAC.
                 (See src\kernel32\makefile for hints how to use it).
                *Synced configuration for the two VAC versions.

                 NOTE that NODEBUGINFO and DEBUGALL is handled within these
                 files. You don't have to test for them to set the correct
                 compiler and linker flags, this is allready done!

 2000-03-04: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - INCLUDE\pdwin32.tools, pdwin.vac*
                   Added new build rules (conditional at this time)
                   For each dll a subdir bin\release & bin\debug is created
                   in which the object files of the release & build version
                   are saved.
        - INCLUDE\pdwin32.post
                   Common makefile rules to be included by all makefiles
        - USER32\KERNEL32: Switched to new build rules
        - WSOCK32: Fixed bug in setsockopt for SO_LINGER (options size wasn't
                   adjusted)
        - KERNEL32: Fixed shell dirs (now all created in odin\bin dir)
                    Partially fixed destruction of loaded dlls in ExitProcess
                    (TODO: dependencies are not yet right; needs new design)
                    Added check and fix for DosOpen (ERROR_TOO_MANY_OPEN_FILES)
                    to hmdevio.cpp
        - USER32: Pass on keyboard messages if dinput handler returns TRUE

                  (TODO: always returns true after calling dinput handler)
        - OPENGL\GLIDE:
                  Added check and fix for DosOpen (ERROR_TOO_MANY_OPEN_FILES)
                  to hmdevio.cpp (reported by Michal Necasek)

                  in the virtualKeyTable

 2000-03-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - KERNEL32: Create shell dirs in odin\bin directory
                    Cleanup (never call Open32 apis directly if the proc
                    isn't a wrapper; include win32api.h and call Odin api)
                    Fixed FS corruption for DosAliasMem
                    Fixed bug in Win32PeLdrImage::commitPage (quake 3 screensaver's
                    fixup section doesn't start on page boundary)
        - ADVAPI32/KERNEL32: Moved registry apis in kernel32 as we need them
                             there (importing them directly creates a circular
                             dependency (kernel32->advapi32->kernel32))
                             Should probably be moved to ntdll
        - WINMM: Fixed typo in DartWaveOut::init to determine bits per sample
                 (Realplayer 7 audio now works (when playing .rm files))

 2000-03-03: Jeroen van den Horn <J.vandenHorn@fibre.a2000.nl>
        - KERNEL32: Fixed calling convention bug in conprop2.cpp

                    if app wants to change dir to "\")
                    Create shell folders + shell keys
                    (NOTE: This has to be done in the odin install program
                           once we have one)
        - ADVAPI32: Added crypt api stubs

 2000-03-01: Jeroen van den Horn <J.vandenHorn@fibre.a2000.nl>
        - OPENGL: Implemented DIVE support in Mesa

 2000-03-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32: Fixes for FindWindow(ExA/W) - now more like Wine
                  (FindWindowExW was not working correctly either)
                  First send WM_NCACTIVATE, then WM_ACTIVATE
                  Fixed focus problems with Odin apps
                  (Call WinSetFocus in OSLibWinSetActiveWindow instead of
                   WinSetActiveWindow when a user clicks on the titlebar
                   of an inactive window & after sending WM_MOUSEACTIVATE)
                  TODO: Does WinSetActiveWindow work properly or should we
                        always call WinSetFocus???
                  Call Dinput handler when translating mouse & keyboard
                  messages (during Get/PeekMessage)
        - OPENGL: Always build release version of glide, mesa, glu32 & glut
                  Build mesa software & 3dfx dlls; don't build OS/2 opengl
                  wrapper anymore
        - OPENGL\GLIDE\CVG\GLIDE:
                  Disable instruction scheduling in release build -> messed up
                  colors when turned on (most likely VAC optimizer bug)
                  TODO: Somebody should also check this for the voodoo 1 glide dll.
        - OPENGL\GLIDE\CVG:
                  Fixed makefile
        - OPENGL\MESA\GL\gl.h
                  Removed circular header dependency (breaks build)
        - OPENGL\MESA\3dfx:
                  Copy 3dfx opengl32.dll to bin\glide

 2000-03-01: Edgar Buerkle <Edgar.Buerkle@gmx.net>

 2000-02-29: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundse@pmsc.no>
        - TOOLS\FASTDEP: Restructured it a little. Support for multiple
                    languages:
                        C and C++ (as earlier)
                        Assembly
                        Resource files (OS/2 resources at least...)
                        COBOL (just for fun! - I'll use it at job)
                    Things seems to work ok, but if an error occurs, please
                    fix it or send me a note and I'll fix it ASAP.

 2000-02-29: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - OPENGL\MESA: Added Odin port of Mesa Opengl library
                      (Ported by Jeroen van den Horn)
          NOTE: The Mesa 3D graphics library has a different license
               (see LICENSE.TXT in the Mesa directory)
        - OPENGL\MESA\3DFX:
                Added Odin port of 3dfx Voodoo Mesa GL
               (tested with simple opengl samples only, but
                this is the first hardware accelerated Opengl
                implementation for OS/2!)
          NOTE: The Mesa 3dfx graphics library has a different license
               (see LICENSE.TXT in the Mesa\3dfx directory)
        - KERNEL32: Only call ExitProcess the first time KillWin32Process
                    is executed. Call DosExit otherwise.
                    Fix for GpdDev device io (needed for native glide dll)

 2000-02-28: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - KERNEL32: Call ExitProcess in KillWin32Process to make sure
                   the dll libmain handlers are called after a crash.
                   (i.e. Glide needs this to restore the display)
        - INCLUDE\WIN: Added wgl definitions to wingdi.h

 2000-02-27: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - WINMM: Implemented waveOutGetPosition

 2000-02-27: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundse@pmsc.no>
        - pdwin32.tools: "New" tool, MAKE_CMD. Passes on the DEBUG and
                    NODEBUGINFO macros variables to the next make job.
                    (It's better to have it here than to have it in nearly
                    all makefiles, and forgetting to put it there...)
        - WIN32K:  *The dep rule will make a makefile.inc if not present. It
                    will also make dependencies for pe2lx and lib.
                   *Have created a lib rule.
                   *The all rule will now make Pe2Lx.
        - src/makefile: win32k makes pe2lx, no need for special pe2lx stuff.

              Sander, have a look the build and rebuild rules please.

 2000-02-26: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundse@pmsc.no>
        - WIN32K: *Symbol Database is implemented. Contains symbols for most
                   retail kernels. (see win32k.txt or readme.txt)
                  *No scanning of the os2krnl file, the loaded image is now
                    scanned to determin which build, debug/retail and smp/uni.
                  *16-bit logging.
                  *Extract.exe rule. Extract.exe program generates the
                   SymDb.c source file found in dev16 from a collections of
                   kernel symbol files.

                (fixes Papyrus error message about CreateIC)
        - COMCTL32: Fixed wrong calling convention for property sheet handlers
                   (prsht.h in include\win)
                     This fixes crashes in VPBUDDY (preferences dialog) AND (!)
                   fixes the empty preferences dialog in both debug & release
                   builds.
                   NOTE: I've fixed similar bugs before. Somebody should verify
                         all comctl32 handlers...

 2000-02-23: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>

        - WIN32K: *Initial support for UNIX-styled scripts
                   (files starting with an #!<interpreter> [args...])
                   This is a _very_ big hack! But never the less it's working.
                   (or at least it seems like working...)
                  *The kernel symbol importer is enhanced to support more
                   generic function prologs and to import variables and
                   16-bit functions.
                  *Segments are now locked in physical memory.
                  (Note, last changes have not been tested on Aurora yet,
                   but it will hopefully work just fine.)

                    Fixed cpuhlp assembly functions (compiler changes calling

                    instead of on the stack)

 2000-02-14: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - COMCTL32: Added Wine license
        - KERNEL32: Search in path for dlls if the pe loader can't find them

        - TOOLS\makefile: fixed clean build
        - src\makefile: fixed clean build
        - src\makefile.smp: fixed incorrect dir change

 2000-02-10: Knut Stange Osmundsen (knut.stange.osmundsen@pmsc.no)
        - *: Updated the source tree to use autogenerated dependencies.
             You will have to do a 'nmake dep' from either /src or / before
             being able to make anything.
             -All makefiles is required to have a 'dep' rule.
             -All dll makefiles is now required to have a 'lib' rule which
              makes the libraries for the module. This rule should also
              check that the library in $(PDWIN32_LIB) is up-to-date.
        - Tools/FastDep: Dependency tool. (Fast=Quick-and-Dirty)
             Moved from /src/win32k. This is currently used to generate
             dependency information.
             Note that it doesn't have any precompiler logic! This is causeing
             some warnings...
        - include/pdwin32.tool: Two new tools DEPEND and DOWITHDIRS.
        - src/makefile: used the DOWITHDIRS to do cleanup, lib and dep.

 2000-02-10: Edgar Buerkle <Edgar.Buerkle@gmx.net>

        - USER32: Implemented WaitForInputIdle
                  ScrollWindow fix; don't call InvalidateRect as WinScrollWindow
                  already invalidates the area (and the call to InvalidateRect was
                  wrong as it has to include the erase flag; should have called
                  RedrawWindow instead)
        - KERNEL32: WinExec: Wait for process to block on input before
                    returning
        - OpenGL base, GLUT, GLU: Added version resource, removed dll exitlist

        - ODIN.INI: OPENGL32.DLL <--> OPENGL.DLL translation, since
                    WinXX OpenGL apps can be dynamically linked with
                    MS OpenGL (OPENGL32.DLL) *or* SGI OpenGL (OPENGL.DLL).

 2000-02-08: Knut Stange Osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen>
        - Win32k: Temporarily disabled some unused imported kernelfunctions.
                  Corrected a problem with overloading _ldrEnum32bitRelRecs;
                  it failed on WS4eB. (Message 'DosDevIOCtl failed')

 2000-02-08: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32: Don't use shell positioning for child windows (breaks Notes)
                  Turn of WM_BACKERASEBKGND when calling RedrawWindow to
                  invalidate a window (without erase flag set; but also without
                  noerase) -> fixes flickering in pingpong Opengl sample
        - KERNEL32: Search path for executables when they can't be found in
                    the current directory.

                  to combine current & new clip region)
        - ADVAPI32: Ported Wine LookupAccountSidA/W (semi-stubs now)

 2000-02-06: Jens Wiessner <wiessnej@rfi.de>

        - KERNEL32: Changed GetProcessDword ordinal to 18
        - USER32: Temporarily commented out shellposition changes
                  (breaks i.e. calc & Notes)
                  Started rewriting BeginPaint/EndPaint + DC apis

 2000-02-06: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
        - USER32: ported WinHelpA from WINE

 2000-02-05: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
        - USER32: WM_SETHOTKEY: save data

        - KERNEL32: Memory map fixes (file maps)
        - USER32: mdi child creation fix (child still not activated when created)
                  Default WM_ERASEBKGND handler change (only erase invalid area)
                  (note: might be wrong; have to check this in NT; probably
                         need to rewrite code that sends those messages)
                  -> fixes redraws for i.e. windows behind menu windows
        - GDI32: Don't use Open32 apis to load opengl32 (nor for GetProcAddress)
                 Import wgl* apis
        - OPENGL: Removed OS2wgl apis (they had the wrong calling convention
                  -> causes crashes in gdi32 when compiled with optimizations on)

 2000-02-04: Markus Montkowski <mmontkowski@gmx.de>
        - DDRAW:  Many minor/major bugfixes at numerous places
        - DSOUND: Fixed GetCurrentBufferPos in the virtual player

               entrypoints)
               Clean up in process detach handler of win32 libmain
               (except for a few core dlls (gdi32/user32/kernel32))
        - DLLENTRY: Standard dll entrypoint

 2000-02-03: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
        - USER32: merged controls with WINE 20000130

 2000-02-03: Daniela Engert <dani@ngrt.de>
        - GDI32: Implement RGB 555 to RGB 565 conversion in assembler

 2000-02-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - WININET: Ported Wininet code from Corel Wine tree
        - INCLUDE\WINSOCK: MS Winsock compatible header
        - GDI32: Prelimary RGB 555 to RGB 565 conversion in SetDIBitsToDevice
                 (will be rewritten in assembly for better performance)
                 (for RealPlayer videos in 16 bits mode)
                 BitBlt fix (return after dibsection blit -> fixes Quake 2)
                 Added MMX RGB conversion.
        - USER32: Added export for OS2ToWin32Handle
        - COMDLG32: Merged with latest Wine version (20000109)
        - INCLUDE\WIN: Fixes to compile comdlg32 in C mode
                 (will be rewritten in assembly for better performance)
                 (for RealPlayer videos in 16 bits mode)
                 BitBlt fix (return after dibsection blit -> fixes Quake 2)

 2000-02-01: Jeroen van den Horn <J.vandenHorn@fibre.a2000.nl>

                 Fixes for dib section apis. RealPlayer 7 can play videos
                 now (correct in 24 bps mode; upside down and wrong colors
                 in 16 bps mode)

 2000-02-01: Knut Stange Osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen>
        - Pe2Lx: Makefile should be working again.
        - KERNEL32: RegisterPe2LxDll - no detach is done for Pe2Lx/Win32k DLLs.
                    This is a temporary fix.

 2000-02-01: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
        - SHELL32: Added PathSkipRootAW

 2000-02-01: Jens Wiessner <wiessnej@rfi.de>
        - NTDLL: Updated .def file (similar to NT 4 SP6) + bugfix for impdef

 2000-01-31: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32: GetDCEx with window handle 0 fails in Windows 98; now it also
                  returns an error in Odin.
                  GetWindowDC & GetDC use the desktop window handle if hwnd == 0
                  (before calling GetDCEx)
        - GDI32: Set dibsection bitmap data to 0 when allocating it.

 2000-01-30: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - PELDR: Fixed error messages for images without fixups (peldr.dll no
                 longer required)
        - GDI32: Removed wrong bugfix for GetDIBits (breaks Lotus Notes)
        - USER32: Don't check for window visibility when calling SetWindowPos
                  in SetMenu. (fixes menu in standard minesweeper)
                  (NOTE: May need to call SetWindowPos with SWP_FRAMECHANGED
                         when showing a window (see Wine code))
                  Put back GetMenuStringA fix (return length of string if string pointer
                  or size parameter == 0) (almost fixes Realplayer 7 menu)

 2000-01-29: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - GDI32: Save and restore FPU control word when calling
                 Open32's DrawText. DrawText trashes it which causes drawing
                 problems in RealPlayer 7.
        - USER32: Call DrawTextA in uitools.cpp, not Open32's DrawText.
                  Fix for SetWindowPos for showing hidden windows
                  (call ShowWindow) -> fixed non-visible button bar in mIRC
                  Don't set WS_VISIBLE on by default. Windows are made visible
                  during creation by calling ShowWindow.
                  Call UpdateWindow for client window, not the frame.
        - INCLUDE\WIN\wingdi.h: Added GdiFlush declaration
        - INCLUDE\makefiles: Added c/c++ definitions for win32 apps (without
          -D__WINE__ so you don't need to specify whether you use the ascii
          or unicode version of a win32 api)

 2000-01-29: Przemyslaw Dobrowolski <dobrawka@asua.org.pl>
        - KERNEL32: Added GlobalWire/GlobalUnwire

 2000-01-28: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - GDI32: Wrong return values for GetDIBits & SetDIBitsToDevice
                 (nr of scan lines copied; not true/false)
        - USER32: Don't call default frame handler for WM_ADJUSTWINDOWPOS
                  (fixes window resize when playing videos in RealPlayer v7 &
                   dragging titlebar in Professional Mine Sweeper)

 2000-01-28: Knut St. Osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@pmsc.no>
        - Win32k: Heap is splitted into a swappable and a resident heap.
                  Fixups are now applied when a page is loaded from disk.
                  This is done by overloading the kernel function called
                  (_)ldrEnum32bitRelRecs. This should improve performance a lot!

 2000-01-27: Jeroen van den Horn <J.vandenHorn@fibre.a2000.nl>
        - OPENGL: First version of opengl implementation

 2000-01-27: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32: Fixed FS corruption in OSLibPostThreadMessage
                  Send WM_CHILDACTIVATE to child windows (not only
                  to MDI children) instead of WM_ACTIVATE
        - SHELL32: Fixed FS corruption in DragAcceptFiles

 2000-01-26: Yuri Dario <mc6530@mclink.it>
        - INCLUDE\WIN: Additions & changes for compiling Opera.

        - PELDR:    Don't modify cmd line in PIB structure
        - INCLUDE:  Removed string.h.
        - KERNEL32: Added workaround for OS/2 DosSetMem bug in VirtualAlloc
                    (if memory is reserved, set read & write page flags)

 2000-01-25: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - PELDR/KERNEL32: Allocate low memory at right address and with right size
                          in peldr.dll (fixes install of Windows Media Player)
        - KERNEL32: Print thread id for each log message

 2000-01-22: Michal Necasek <mike@mendelu.cz>
        - DINPUT: Fixes + basic functionality is complete; enough for many games

 2000-01-21: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32: Put back old WM_MOVE, MsgFormatChanged & OSLibSWPToWINDOWPOSFrame
                  Previous changes broke many apps (VPBuddy, MIrc32)
                  Don't update window if style changes (responsibility of the app)
                  Store window menu & id in same variable (fixes clock ->
                  double click on analog window -> titlebar & menu gone; menu
                  used to stay there)
                  Put back WM_CALCVALIDRECT code in pmwindow. Fixes updates
                  of clock window (who's class has CS_H/VREDRAW style).
        - KERNEL32: Fixed image loading for resource lookup only (don't care
                    where those images are loaded as we only use it to query
                    the version resource; so base address doesn't matter)
                    (-> RealPlayer 7 installs now)

 2000-01-20: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - KERNEL32: Disabled creation of pe_x.log if logging disabled
                    Only get codepage once from odin.ini.

        - KERNEL32: Codepage bugfix & unicode translation changes (heapstring.cpp)
        - GDI32:    Added codepage support for CreateCompatibleDC

 2000-01-20: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
        - USER32: fixed WM_CONTEXTMENU
                  dispatch WM_MOUSEMOVE in menu loop

 2000-01-18: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32: Removed 'old' user32 and replaced it with the new one
                  Call default window proc when DefMDIChildProcA/W is called
                  for a non-MDI window.
                  Fixed menu check & submenu marks painting

        - WINMM\WAVEMAP
          Updated to Wine level 20000109 + corrected compile
        - MCICDA: ported MCICDA.DLL from Wine 20000901 (Linux cdrom calls stubbed
                  so it doesn't work)

 2000-01-17: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32\NEW: Added basic support for DInput WM_CHAR notification
                      (the rest needs to be done in dinput.dll)
                      Use KEYBOARD_Enable user32 export to (un)register WM_CHAR
                      handler. (WNDPROC type) It's called when a WM_CHAR message
                      arrives for an Odin window with hwnd, msg, wParam & lParam.
        - DINPUT:     Fixed bugs reported by Michal Necasek

 2000-01-16: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>

                      don't move/size maximized windows

 2000-01-15: Jens Wiessner <wiessnej@rfi.de>
        - TWAIN_32: Update
        - WINMM\MCIANIM,MCIAVI32,MCISEQ,MCIWAVE,MIDIMAP
                    Updated to Wine level 20000109 + corrected compile errors
        - WINMM: Ported Wine wave mapper.

 2000-01-15: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32\NEW: Fixed scroll repaints (never use GetMessage with window
                      handle as that can prevent WM_PAINTs from being dispatched)
                      (may need reworking of Get/PeekMessage instead)
                      ScrollWindow changes
                      Removed frame drawing 'bugfix'.
                      Fixed system menu position for child windows (i.e. MDI)
                      Fixed titlebar tracking for child windows (i.e. MDI)
        - KERNEL32:   Check for null pointers in lstrcmpA

 2000-01-15: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
        - USER32/NEW: cache menu and caption drawing
                      changed minimize button position
                      don't redraw system menu icon in menu.cpp
                      hilighted menubar items don't have an edge in Win9x
                      don't open system menu on mouseover if menubar is used and vice versa
                      show sysmenu on WM_NCRBUTTONUP with HTCAPTION set (todo: position)
                      use WIN32_STDCLASS2 for windows with CS_SAVEBITS class style

 2000-01-14: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
        - USER32/NEW: added caption clipping for faster window text updates

 2000-01-14: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32\NEW: Fixed min/max bug for mdi child windows
                      Fixed DrawMenuBar (invalidate frame rectangle in
                      FrameUpdateClient if client rectangle wasn't changed)
                      Fixed bugs in MsgFormatFrame & SendNCCalcSize
                      Fixed WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED translation for frame window (not done yet)
                      (Winamp works now)
                      Removed code that's no longer used (subclassed OS/2 frame
                      controls & OS/2 scrollbar functions etc)

 2000-01-13: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
        - USER32\NEW: WM_ACTIVATEAPP should be sent when another process' window
                      is activated or deactivated
                      Send correct thread id for non-Odin windows in WM_ACTIVATEAPP
                      Set window handle of non-Odin window to window desktop in WM_ACTIVATE
                      Return window desktop handle for window handle returned by
                      SetActiveWindow if window is non-Odin.
                      Fixed activation of windows. (send WM_ACTIVATE when receiving
                      a WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED message in pmframe.cpp)
                      Fixed DrawFrame; bottom & right frame borders now drawn correctly
                      Fixed scrollbar positioning (style.exe)
                      Fixed CS_OWNDC for GetDCEx (DCX_WINDOW); don't use a window
                      DC to save/restore a window's own dc.
                      Fixed client rectangle problems. Client rectangles
                      are always in frame coordinates; window rectangles in
                      screen coordinates. Whenever necessary (i.e WM_MOVE)
                      client coordinates are converted to coordinates relative
                      to it's parent client window.
                      Changed WM_MOVE -> client coordinates relative to parent origin
                      if child; otherwise relative to screen origin. (needs testing)
                      (WM_NCCALCSIZE needs to be done as well)
        - COMCTL32:   Version resource version nrs changed (based on NT 4 SP3)
        - KERNEL32:   Added DisableLogging & EnableLogging functions to
                      disable logging in parts of code. Logging will only be
                      done if the logcount is bigger than 0.
