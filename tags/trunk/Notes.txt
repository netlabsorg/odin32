- GetBitmapDimensionEx returns (0,0) for icon bitmaps (TODO)
- Open32 returns double height of icon masks (correct for OS/2, but
  not for color win32 icon color bitmaps!) ('workaround' present)

- AH: There is a problem in regedit where the treeview/header strings
      have a trailing 0xA character - bug in string resource handling
      or should it be removed by the controls (woraround present but
      outcommented). Loading regedit.exe into resource editor does not
      show the 0xA!

- AH: Syscolors are not matched correctly, OS/2 does not take the
      exact RGB color but rather something "similar"
