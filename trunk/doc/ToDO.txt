To Do list for ODIN:


Assigned Status Topic -------------------------------------------------------

PH              Implement WaitForSingleObject() for process handles

PD       DONE   Handle named pipes via HandleManager

MM       DONE   Do COM (serial port) support for ODIN (requires
                pseudo-device in HM)

PH       DONE   Sync SHELL32 with WINE

SvL             Add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WINDOWS\CurrentVersion
                Key CommonFilesDir="?:\Program Files\Common Files" for
                TogetherJ installation to the ODIN installer.

PH              Sync NTDLL with WINE

JW              Put in correct FS:-wrappers in CRTDLL and MSVCRT

JW              Improve CRTDLL and MSVCRT as this is one major show stopper 
                currently

SvL             Remove GPI32 calls from the original FS: macros and replace
                them with ODINFUNCTION wrappers. Internally call to ODIN_xxx
                GPI functions to get much better performance.

NOONE           long2ShortName in kernel32\oslibdos.cpp
NOONE           FindFirstFileA -> use 64 bits OS/2 api
NOONE           Out of process COM objects (OLE). Important because new
                InstallShield installers use this feature!

NOONE           WINSPOOL: Implement remaining apis and complete existing
                          The Win32 printer api resembles the PM spool API quite a lot!

NOONE           KERNEL32: Build fake PE headers for odin dlls (dll handle must be pointer to header)
                          (some applications use the handles as pointers)
                        (partially done)
                        
NOONE  DONE     USER32: Fix LoadImage to resize icons, cursors or bitmaps
                        to the specified dimensions (if required)

NOONE           WINMM: wave recording

NOONE           WINMM: Rewrite winmm to use driver architecture (port Wine's winmm
                       + integrate current Odin code)

NOONE           WINMM: Fix and finish MIDI in/out (using RTMIDI)

NOONE	        KERNEL32: Async file io

NOONE           KERNEL32: Vio support for console applications
                        (partially done)

NOONE           WSOCK32: Winsock 2 implementation (WS2_32.DLL, WS2HELP.DLL)

NOONE           GDI32: Rewrite using Gpi api (remove Open32 dependancy)

NOONE           Setup a test /verification plan and freeze some modules such
                as LZ32, VERSION which are considered complete.
                Also ensure the source code is well documented and structured.
