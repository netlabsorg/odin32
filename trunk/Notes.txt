- GetBitmapDimensionEx returns (0,0) for icon bitmaps (TODO)
- Open32 returns double height of icon masks (correct for OS/2, but
  not for color win32 icon color bitmaps!) ('workaround' present)

- AH: Registry entires have trailing newline character 0xA. Could
      be a bug in the registry write code

- AH: Syscolors are not matched correctly, OS/2 does not take the
      exact RGB color but rather something "similar"
