    - USER32:   o Edit control: Limits removed. EM_SETTEXTLIMIT has no effect in 
                  NT4, SP6 (EM_GETTEXTLIMIT only returns that value).
                  Limits are simply ignored, no EN_MAXTEXT notification is ever sent.
                  (fixes license edit control in Microsoft Visual C++ 4.2 install)
                o Static control: SS_REALSIZEIMAGE is supposed to prevent 
                  control resizing, but that doesn't appear to happen in NT 
                  (although the SDK docs are very clear about this)
                  Need to figure out why. (not resizing messes up the bitmap 
                  control in the Microsoft Visual C++ 4.2 install program)
                  Same thing happens with a very simply test app, so the installer
                  does nothing special.
    - WNASPI32: o Fixed bug in access aspi method. (wait check reversed)
    - MAKEFILES:o Update for overriding stack size of executables
    - PELDR:    o Fixed makefiles (PEC was built as a PM app -> must be VIO!)

 2000-12-12: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o GetVolumeInformationA bugfix (lpFileSystemNameBuffer == NULL &
                  lpFileSystemFlags != NULL)
                o Wrong calls to VirtualFree in memory map & tls code (size must be zero)
                o Shared memory address retrieved with DosGetNamedSharedMem not properly freed

 2000-12-12: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   o Fixed problem with newer kernels having a different
                  prolog to ldrCheckInternalName. (Seems like either new
                  compiler or better optimization.)
                o Corrected bad loop condition in configure.cmd causing
                  a neverending loop during build.
    - Win32kCC: o Corrected the setting of the -DllFixes parameter.
    - readme.txt:
                o Corrected minor flaw: Win32k option "-PE" should be "-Pe".

 2000-12-10: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   o Fixed minor error in the *printf function.
                o Added the 14063 kernels (*1129[d].zip).
                o Removed OS/2 kernel limit for DLL name length.
                  (Experimental - see readme.txt option -Dllfixes.)
                o Removed OS/2 kernel restriction for DLL extention.
                  (Experimental - see readme.txt option -Dllfixes.)
    - readme.txt:
                o Updated win32k.sys with new parameter, -Dllfixes.

 2000-12-09: Patrick Haller <patrick.haller@innotek.de>ú
    - KERNEL32: o accelerated FindFirst/FindNext calls (oslibdos.cpp)ú
    - makefile: o added support for "profile" debug buildú

 2000-12-09: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - GDI32:    o Temporary fix for bugs introduced by recent handle changes.

 2000-12-07: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - USER32:   o Changed CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS overrides to a CDEFINES override.
                  (This is the new way to alter the standard C and C++ defines.)

 2000-12-07: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Missing USING_OPEN32 define in makefile. Might be responsible
                  for a lot of problems that have recently emerged.

 2000-12-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Must call selectClientArea after GpiSetClipRegion in BeginPaint
                  When a window with CS_OWNDC looses focus, for some reason
                  GpiSetClipRegion resets the window dc origin back to (0,0).
                  (fixes e.g. Visual C++ 4.2 setup when switching between
                   setup window & another app)
    - KERNEL32: o Rewrote GetLogicalDrives
                o Minor fixes for GetDriveType (return value equals DRIVE_NO_ROOT_DIR
                  for junk input; does not change last error)

 2000-12-06: Patrick Haller <patrick.haller@innotek.de>
    - USER32:   o added debug macros to HOOK_ functions
    - GDI32:    o added debug macros to Font related functions

 2000-12-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o 16 bits menu handles are now supported (fixes crash in MultiEdit)
    - GDI32:    o Changes to local object handle management (for user32 menus)
    - KERNEL32: o Don't assume resources start at section boundary.
                  Must use DataDirectory virtual address.
                  (fixes winrar self-extracting executables)

 2000-12-03: chris.wohlgemuth <chris.wohlgemuth@cityweb.de>
    - KERNEL32: o Fix for TVFS & GetDiskFreeSpaceA (Windows Media Player
                  install complains about cluster size)
                  (DRIVESPACE section, key CLUSTERTO32 in odin.ini)
                o Fix in PROFILE_GetSection for crash in Windows Media Player install
    - WINMM:    o Ported Wine MCI code

 2000-12-03: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - TOOLS\install:
                o More installation script fixes.
    - Win32k:   o Fatal error! I mixed flags for C and C++ compilation during
                  makefile rewrite. This caused C++ exceptionhandlers to be
                  generated and registered, leading to Trap 000e during boot.
                o Confirmed working on the Warp 4 14.060 (at least halfstrict)
                  kernel (w41106.zip).

 2000-12-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - TOOLS\install:
                o Installation script fixes.

 2000-12-03: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - *, makefiles, pdwin32k.*, odin32.*.mk, Configure.cmd:
                o Made some addjustments to the makefiles. Most important
                  eliminating nearly all ODIN32_<dir> directory macros.
                o Changed all "PDWIN32_" to "ODIN32_".
                o Renamed pdwin32.$(CCENV).* to pdwin32.*.$(CCENV).mk
                  and pdwin32.* to odin32.*.mk.
                o Added tiny rexx script, Configure.cmd, which generates
                  a file with absolute directory macros; makefile.inc.
                  Makefile.inc also includes /include/odin32.mk.
                  NB. This script is automatically invoked the first time
                  you start nmake or wmake on /makefile.
                o Restructured the win32k.sys makefiles. Now all but
                  the win32k.sys makefile is using the new makefile style.
                o The tools makefiles are mostly according to the new style.
                o Compiler and debug/release specific library directory.
                  ODIN32_LIB will now point to a compiler specific directory
                  under /lib. Debug and release files are also separated.
                o The <>exp.def are now generated in the $(OBJDIR) directory.
                o .lib-files are also targeted to $(OBJDIR).
                o More Watcom friendly makefiles. (I didn't say that they are
                  working with Watcom! I removed VAC dependencies when
                  possibled or else tried to make wmake fail.)
                o Moved readmes in the /bin/glide tree to the source
                  directories under opengl.
    - tools/install:
                o Removed odininst.wis - odin.cmd generates this.
                o Tried to make odin.cmd more readable; uses
                  the wic.exe option -c <dir> to set current directory.
                  ARG! Why can't wic.exe return anything but 0? When files
                  aren't found for example, I have no way of finding it out.
                o Added package which adds win32k.sys to the config.sys.
                  Seems like I have to add a file to that packet, so win32k.ddp
                  works as dummy file. It also seems like there is a but in
                  WarpIn 0.95 - it inserts the line between the '\r' and the '\n'
                  chars at the end of the previous line.

 2000-12-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o Added renaming for MCICDA (MCICDA.DLL -> MCICDA.DRV)

 2000-12-02: chris.wohlgemuth <chris.wohlgemuth@cityweb.de>
    - WINMM\MCICDA:
                o Rewrote it for OS/2
