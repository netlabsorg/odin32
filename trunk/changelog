    - Win32k:   ú Added IOCtl API for Reading or Writing into another process'
                  address space. (*ProcessReadWrite)
                  This is intended used to implemented ReadProcessMemory and
                  WriteProcessMemory (which is essensial to debuggers I think).
                  I'll implementet them soon, but it sees that it'll
                  require more changes in process.c that I first thought.
                ú Simplified maintaince of kernel imports. (mkcalltab)
                  Removed unused imports.
