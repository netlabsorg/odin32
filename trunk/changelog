    - tools\dailybuild:
                o Updated with temporary server address.
                o Put ftp userid/passwords into separate file.
                o Build number incrementation. (Stored in versionos2.h)
                  (Use bldlevel on the DLLs to look at it.)
                o Splitted out 3dxf/glide stuff into separat .zips.

    - Win32k:   o Added support for the ldrCheckInternalName bug. :-)
                  (see /src/win32k/ldr/myldrCheckInternalName.cpp for details.)
                o Made pe.exe default.
                o Added UNI and SMP 14062 kernels (convenience pack).
                  (Have anyone got the Warp 4 convenience pack with the right .sym files?)

    - bin\bldlevelinf.cmd:
                o Removed colon after otherwise to make it work with Object REXX.

    - makefiles:
                o Merged BuildLevel revisions with the LXOpt revisions.
                  (There seems like there have been some kind of revision mixup in
                   Sanders tree?)
                o Updated the other post files with LXOpt.

 2001-01-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - install:  o Win32k installation temporarily disabled due to a WarpIn bug
                  (config.sys lines removed)
                o Update: This is NOT a WarpIn bug, but an error in the script.
                          Now fixed.
                o Added check for WarpIn 0.9.6 or higher
                o Added check for OS/2 3.x or higher
    - src\makefile:
                o Exclude msvcrt from build process.
                  (download odinapp.zip from ftp.os2.org to install a small
                   MFC app with MFC + MSVCRT dlls)

 2001-01-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - makefiles:o Use LXLite for release build binaries (better compression)
                  Can't use it for debug binaries as IPMD doesn't like it.

 2001-01-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: o KERNEL32_99 should return 1 (according to Wine)
                o KERNEL32_100 export added (stub)
    - USER32:   o Rewrote window handle management; only start reusing window
                  handles when max handle has been assigned.
    - GDI32/USER32/KERNEL32:
                o Don't export private Odin functions by name (we import
                  everything by ordinal)

 2001-01-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32:   o Menu cast bugfix (bitmap handle is 32 bits)
                  (Fixes menu bitmaps in Lotus Notes 5)
