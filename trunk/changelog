 1999-12-31: Przemyslaw Dobrowolski <dobrawka@asua.org.pl>
	- WINMM: Implemented waveOutGet/SetVolume
	- KERNEL32: Fixed bugs in iccio.asm (OFFSET FLAT:devname)

 1999-12-31: Edgar Buerkle <Edgar.Buerkle@gmx.net>
	- KERNEL32: Started with implementation of debug apis & support
                    for debugging win32 apps (mostly for additional logging)

 1999-12-30: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
	- USER32: ported menu control from WINE (not yet activated)
		  ported icontitle control from WINE
		  added winswitch control (stub)

	- KERNEL32: Added stubs for Load/FreeLibrary16 & GetProcAddress16
                    (ordinals 35,36 & 37)
                    Added support for SEC_COMMIT memory map flag
                    Don't fail for unknown handles in (Msg)WaitForMultipleObject;
                    they could be thread or process handles (which we don't translate)
	- USER32:   Load bitmaps file completely in LoadBitmapA. Creating
                    a file mapping with reserved memory has little use
                    as the entire file will be read completely anyway.
                    Added some useful logging for DDE apis.
                    Fixed problem with combo boxes refusing to expand if it
                    the edit control doesn't have the focus.
	- GDI32:    Fixed GetObject for DIB sections
	- COMCTL32: Increased default height of rebar band from 20 to 36
                    (temporary hack for AbiWord)

 1999-12-30: Bart van Leeuwen <Bart_van_Leeuwen@netage.nl>

 1999-12-29: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
	- USER32: rewrote coordinate mapping (map*) and fixed some 1 pixel bugs
		  pro memoria:
		    point:     newY   = windowH-1-oldY
		    rectangle: newTop = windowH-oldTop
		  fixed some wrong window handles
		  Win32BaseWindow: added getClientHeight/Width,
		  getWindowHeight returns now the window height

 1999-12-29: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
	- INCLUDE: ODINWRAP: new macros to save FS register for callback registration
	- WINMM:   removed memory leak for win32 tib fs selectors in DartWaveOut::callback

                 NOTE: You must include os2mewrap.h instead of os2me.h
	- USER32: Fixed PostThreadMessage (RealPlayer G2 install almost works)
                  Fixed memory leak in PostMessage (structures of posted messages 
                  that aren't dispatched were never freed)
                  (InterVideo WinDVD 2.0 install almost works; tries to overwrite
                   msvcrt.dll (which fails as the install program uses that dll))
                  Fixed version resource (based on NT 4 SP3)
	- KERNEL32: Removed logging from icon & cursor (group) conversion
                    (compile with DEBUGALL=1 to enable it)
                    Added version resource (based on NT 4 SP3)
	- GDI32: Added version resource (based on NT 4 SP3)
	- MSVCRT/20/40: Added version information based on NT 4 SP3 msvcrt dlls

 1999-12-28: Vit Timchishin <tvv@sbs.kiev.ua>
	- USER32: Listbox fix; Commented out 'if (index == oldsel) return LB_OKAY;'
                  in LISTBOX_SetSelection as this may prevent the control from
                  sending a notification after a change with notify disabled.
                  (i.e. MoveCarret)

 1999-12-28: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>

          rasapi32, version:
                    Added commented-out exports and changed ordinals to match 
                    with the dlls from Windows NT 4.0 ServicePack 6 or Windows 
                    98SE

	- KERNEL32: Enable write access for code sections which have this flag
                    set in the PE image (fixes crash in WinDVD)

	- USER32: Fixed bug in OSLibWinQueryQueueStatus (uninitialized local variable)
	          Changed message handling. Messages are translated in Get/PeekMessage
                  now. (or in the PM window handler, if it was sent directly)
                  TranslateMessage now translates WM_(SYS)KEYDOWN/UP to

                 more colorconversion code:
                  8bit to all hicolormodes(16,24,32) and 
                  between the highcolormodes
                 Do Colorfills for the above modes. 
                 Removed inhertiance from IBASE in DDRectangle

	- NTDLL/CRTDLL: Moved all CRT functions into CRTDLL
                        CRTDLL should contain all shared RTL functions (in addition
                        to those present in the win32 version); this is more
                        consistent than putting half the rtl functions in NTDLL
                        and the rest in CRTDLL.
	- CRTDLL: Fixed memory allocation bug (CRTDLL_calloc called calloc, while
                  free calls HeapFree; everything uses private CRTDLL heap now)
	- MSVCRT: Removed all forwarders from def file. Link with CRTDLL instead.
                  NOTE: Non-existant forwarders don't generate errors when loading
                        this dll!!!
                        Linking with a lib makes sure the import really exists.
	- KERNEL32: Moved memmove to NTDLL (forwarded to CRTDLL)
	- ODINCRT: Added wrappers for file io functions (to prevent FS corruption)

 1999-12-20: Rene Pronk <R.Pronk@twi.tudelft.nl>
	- WINMM: Bugfixes in waveOutOpen (flags) for winamp

 1999-12-20  Markus Montkowski <mmontkowski@gmx.de>

	- USER32: changed icon title font size in SystemParametersInfo to 12
		  fixed DrawIcon/DrawIconEx
		  fixed GetIconInfo (still bugs in load/create code)

 1999-12-20: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- CRTDLL: Added bsearch from EMX
	- MSVCRT: Copy dlls into bin directory. Most apps seem to work
                  (Notes, solitaire, winhlp32)
	- NTDLL: Added qsort, ftol, CIpow, ltoa, ultoa
                 (ftol fixes black Notes toolbars)

 1999-12-20: Jens Wiessner <wiessnej@rfi.de>
	- MSVCRT: Added stubs

 1999-12-19: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
	- USER32: fixed child positioning
		  removed CS_SIZEREDRAW, do it manually if window really needs it
		   handled in WM_CALCVALIDRECTS, PM aligns windows top-left
		   -> much faster, Calc: radiobuttons are at the right place
		      RegEdit: treeview redraw problems fixed

 1999-12-19: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- ADVAPI32/NTDLL: Forward sid apis to ntdll (need to check return
                          type of some Rtl SID apis (bool or status dword?))
                          Moved Service apis into separate sourcefile
                          Implemented some service apis (not completely)
	- KERNEL32: Fix for loading images (RSRC_LOAD)
                    Implemented FindResourceExA/W
                    CreateProcessW bugfix (string conversion)
		    FormatMessageA/W bugfix (wrong calling convention for 
                    WVSPRINTFAPROC type (should be WIN32API!) -> fixes crash
                    in regedit
	- USER32: SendMessageW bugfix

                  implemented though)
	- AVIFIL32: updated with the latest code from Wine 991212.
	- KERNEL32: Partly implemented GetCurrencyFormatA/W (not correct, but 
                    to make apps happy)
                    Added handlemanager class for tokens and HMHandleGetUserData
                    export to query the userdata dword of a handle.

 1999-12-14: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- USER32: Tasklist fix
                  Rewrote SendMessage handling; Uses WinSendMsg now if window
                  is created by a different process/thread.
                  Started with port of Wine hook code
                  ShowWindowAsync calls ShowWindow now (not correct, but better than nothing)
	- KERNEL32: Added GetTHDBFromThreadId (used in USER32) & link THDB structures during creation

        - INCLUDE\WIN\winnt.h: Header fixes
	- Porting.txt: Fixed sample makefile (you need to add -D__i386__ as compiler option)
	- USER32:   NotifyParent bugfix (use id & handle of 1st child window)

	- KERNEL32: Fixes for on-demand page loader; currently disabled by
                    default because it interferes with debugging (too many
                    exceptions are generated)
                    To enable it undefine COMMIT_ALL in kernel32\winimagepeldr.cpp.
                    Dll unload fix for PE loader (fixes crash when Notes quits)
	- PE2LX:    Don't link with odincrt -> 'Not enough storage to complete

	  //To use private dll logging, define PRIVATE_LOGGING and
	  //add Open/ClosePrivateLogFiles (see below) functions to the dll
	  //to open close the private logfile. The logfile handle should
	  //be stored in the _privateLogFile variable
	  //dprintf can be called like this:
	  //dprintf((LOG, "PE file           : %s", szFileName));

                    trying to open existing mapping
                    commitPage: Commit page by page, not entire range (could

                    key and necessary subkeys (including CSD version)
                    Corrected return value of Read/WriteFile (must be boolean, not 
                    an error code)
	- USER32: Major changes for window procedures
                  Now identical to Wine. Window is unicode only if it's
                  window procedure comes from a unicode class.
                  Add thunk code for procedures to store type.

                  Disabled CS_OWNDC support for now -> otherwise certain
                  windows never receive a WM_ERASEBKGND message. (memory SDK sample)
                  Fix for Abiword & memory.exe -> extra check for owndc in Begin/EndPaint

 1999-12-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>

 1999-11-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- COMDLG32: Import from shlwapi as the original Wine code does
	- SHELLL32: Added exports
	- SHLWAPI:  Link with shell32.lib for forwarders + added exports
	- USER32:   Fixed mouseactivate for subclassed OS/2 windows (scrollbars)
		    Fixed CreateIconIndirect (Wine file dialog now shows button
		    icons correctly)
		    Don't clear WS_CLIPSIBLINGS bit in OSSetWindowStyle.
		    Removed fix in PMFRAME WM_ADJUSTWINDOWPOS: Previous fix breaks
		    a lot of apps (button.exe/style.exe/header4.exe)
		    (fix = call default frame handler when receiving this msg
		     when the window hasn't been 'created' yet)

 1999-11-03: Christoph Bratschi <cbratschi@datacomm.ch>
	- USER32: fixed modal dialogs
		  added WM_CONTEXTMENU
	- COMCTL32: implemented statusbar size grip

 1999-11-03: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
	- KERNEL32:	Fix:	undocumented behaviour in SearchPathA
				and bugfix in SearchPathW
	- USER32:	Fix:	TrackPopupMenuEx lpPM can be NULL
			Fix	LoadBitmapA checked for incorrect return value

 1999-11-02  Markus Montkowski <mmontkowski@gmx.de>
	- DDRAW: Changed debug output to DDRAW: ...
		 Copied Framebuffer if in colorconversion mode for Normal Blits to
		 the primary surface. => Map Editor of Red Alert works.

 00-11-02: Achim Hasenmueller <achimha@innotek.de>
	- COMCTL32: Incorporated latest WINE 991031 updates
	  Note: listview doesn't paint properly now. Will be fixed later.

 1999-11-02: Markus Montkowski <mmontkowski@gmx.de>
	- DDRAW: Changed interface handling of Surfaces=> Quake 2 runs again!

 1999-11-02: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
	- SHELL32:	Up to current WINE level
	- SHLWAPI:	Created (in WINE it mostly links to SHELL32)

 1999-11-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- INCLUDE\odinwrap.h:
		  fixed wrong define (_ODINWARP instead of _ODINWRAP)
		  Only check the heap for consistency when DEBUG_ODINHEAP is
		  defined.
	- USER32: Uncommented EDIT_NOTIFY_PARENT call in EDIT_WM_SetFocus
		  (yesterday's showwindow fix makes sure no WM_SETFOCUS msgs
		   arrive before the dialog received it's WM_INITDIALOG msg)
		  Fixed more FS corruption in dc.cpp.
	- SHELL32: Added extra exports for comdlg32
	- COMDLG32: Ported Wine file & find common dialogs (991031)
		    Find & Replace dialogs enabled, Wine code called for
		    file dialogs if the app supplies a dialog template.
		    NOTE: Disabled for now. Comctl32 isn't stable enough
			  for the Win95 style Wine comdlg dialogs.
		    Fixed check for find/replace dialog. Notepad uses 32 byte
		    buffer, so why does the wine code fail for < 80 bytes?
		    Fixed display of find/replace dialog -> if not hooked
		    show dialog!
	- makefiles: Added debugsmp/nodebuginfosmp/releasesmp options to
		     start two nmake process to build everything on two cpus.

 1999-11-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
	- USER32: Delete all process windows & classes in exitlist handler
		  Set hwndInsertBehind to HWND_BOTTOM for group boxes
		  (fixes problems when groupbox control is defined after
		   controls inside it in dialog template)
		  Mouse activate fix.
		  Don't activate child windows in ShowWindow.
	- WINMM: Return failure for waveOutGetDevCapsA/W when there's no
		 audio hardware present.


 1999-11-01: Daniela Engert <dani@ngrt.de>
	- USER32: add WS_CLIPSIBLINGS to not-WS_GROUP style STATIC controls
		  (fixes missing text in WELCOME)

	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	This is a hack!

	Dialog controls which contain/surround other controls *need* to be
	created with the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS style.

	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
