    - tools/install: Added a stram 'close' on the changelog.
                     (4OS2 can't copy files which are opened for write(?).
                     The changelog has to be closed after copying it into
                     the odininst.wis file.)
    - tools/DailyBuild:
                     - Creates .WPI releases too.
                       (odin32pack.cmd and odin32ftp2.cmd)
                     - WarpIn is added to the build environment variables
                       (odin32env.cmd).

    - USER32:       Fixed wrong dispatch of WM_NCHITTEST
                    Fixed DC leak in EndPaint (reset hps type to TYPE_1)
                    -> resulted in out of memory and very slow PM operations
                    -> ICQ 2000a install now finishes (used to run out of mem)
                    Rewrote window management; now one PM window (non-frame)
                    is created for each win32 window (used to be a frame/client
                    pair)
                    -> speeds up drawing & fixes some repaint problems
                    Window coordinates (internally stored) are now relative
                    to window parent (or screen coord. if no parent); client
                    coordinates relative to the frame window
                    GetParent now returns owner if toplevel window
                    SetParent hides and shows window when changing parent
                    Added support for DCX_USESTYLE, DCX_CLIPSIBLINGS, DCX_CLIPCHILDREN
                    and DCX_PARENTCLIP in GetDCEx
                    Rewrote Set/GetWindowPlacement + SetInternalWindowPos (Wine port)
                    Manual minimize, maximize & restore in ShowWindow + fixes
                    TODO: Repaint problems, move child windows when client position/size
                          changes
                    SetParent/GetParent fixes for desktop parent.
    - SHELL32:      Disabled system tray window for now. (appears in top/right
                    of the desktop otherwise)

    - WINMM:        Don't start playback when WaveOutRestart is called
                    before any buffers have been added.
                    Clear WHDR_INQUEUE bit for buffers returned in WaveOutReset

    - Win32k/REXX:  Rewrote the REXX stub program in assembly.
                    (exe size: 688 bytes) Might be able to embedd it in
                    win32k.sys... (not priority)

 2000-06-02: Jeroen van den Horn <J.vandenHorn@fibre.a2000.nl>

                    Put file io apis in separate handlemanager object class
                    Rewrote most file io apis; includes support for 64 bits file
                    pointer/size:
                    - CreateFile/OpenFile/DuplicateHandle/CloseHandle
                    - ReadFile(Ex)/WriteFileEx/GetFileType/GetFileInformationByHandle
                    - SetEndOfFile/SetFileTime/GetFileTime/GetFileSize
                    - SetFilePointer/LockFile(Ex)/UnlockFile(Ex)/FlushFileBuffers
                    Fixed some OpenFile bugs. Put Read/WriteFileEx into file
                    io class. Fixed LockFileEx/UnlockFileEx
                    New file apis use OS/2 apis now; overlapped IO not yet
                    supported.
