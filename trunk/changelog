 2000-10-09: Yuri Dario <mc6530@mclink.it>
    - USER32: Corrected background brush for MDI windows

 2000-10-09: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
    - KERNEL32: Fixed console bug (left offset) reported by Michal

 2000-10-08: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32: FrameTrackFrame fix for child windows
              Ported Wine's ShowOwnedPopups (not tested)

 2000-10-08: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - USER32: GetMinMaxInfo fix for windows with both WS_THICKFRAME and
              WS_BORDER style (differs from Wine; see comment in win32basepos.cpp
              Win32BaseWindow::GetMinMaxInfo)
              Fix for CS_OWNDC windows (origin of client window needs to be changed
              after window size/position changes)
              Fix for ShowScrollBar (enabling/disabling both scrollbars at once did not work (vert))
              AdjustWindowRectEx fix:
                Scrollbars aren't checked *UNLESS* the style includes a border (any border)
                --> VERIFIED IN NT4, SP6 (fixes MFC apps with scrollbars + bar controls)
    - KERNEL32: Do not export the toolhelp apis; NT4 doesn't do that. (only win9x)

 2000-10-07: Markus Montkowski <mmontkowski@gmx.de>
    - GDI32: Fixed bitblt, it used the size of the source DC
             when no destwindow was found. this doesn't work
             for bitblt between dibsections if the dest is larger.
             so now it checks if the dest DC belongs to a dibsection
             and uses sets hdcHeight/Width to the size of the dibsection.
             Added GetWidth() member function for this.
             Fixes: Civilisation Test of Times

 2000-10-06: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: PE loader: no longer rely on section names, but on image
                directories instead
                Init console earlier. (before exe is loaded; some dlls want
                to send output to the console while they're being loaded)
                EnumResourceNamesW/EnumResourceTypesW fixes (strings not terminated)
                CreateProcessA/W fix for setting current directory of new process;
                Open32 ignores lpCurrentDirectory parameter
    - PELDR:    Special parameter for setting current directory added (/OPT[CURDIR=x])
    - USER32:   Ignore class background brush in DefDlgProc for WM_ERASEBKGND
                (always use GetSysColorBrush(COLOR_BTNFACE))
                (Wine does this and it fixes the 1st dialog of the Netscape 6 install)
                OemToCharBuffA fix; put back special characters that got translated
                to 0xff (fixes Netscape 6 install license edit control)

 2000-10-05: Michal Necasek <mike@mendelu.cz>
    - KERNEL32: FormatMessageA/W fix; message ids can be larger than 65535
                (VACPPWIN)

 2000-10-05: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: Don't print FS warnings for OS/2 Odin applications
                EnumResourceNamesA fix (zero terminate resource name)
    - USER32:   GetWindow GW_CHILD & GW_HWNDFIRST fixes
                EnumDisplaySettingsA; always set refresh rate to 70hz
                Z-order bugs fixed; GetWindow returns windows in correct order now
                hack for groupbox (clipsiblings) no longer necessary. Same
                goes for adding WS_CLIPSIBLINGS style for dialog controls.
                Re-enabled usage of invalid region instead of invalid rectangle
                in BeginPaint -> lots of paint problems gone (i.e. winzip)

 2000-10-05: Michal Necasek <mike@mendelu.cz>
    - KERNEL32: Fixes for exception handling (as done by MSVCRT)
     
 2000-10-05: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - tools\common: Implemented read and write buffering for class kFile
                to speed up kDef2Wat and ImpDef.

 2000-10-04: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: Added forwarder support for PE loader (required for msvcrt40.dll)

 2000-10-04: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - tools\ImpDef: Corrected wrong DESCRIPTION statement.
                Corrected exception when processing src\icmp\icmp.def.

 2000-10-03: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - Include\uniconv.h
                FS wrappers for Unicode api
    - Include\heapstring.h:
                strcasecmp & strncasecmp are case insensitive (fixes
                profile apis (and probably some other things too))
    - KERNEL32: Calculate cpu speed and set HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\CentralProcessor\x\~Mhz key
                Added GetFileType method to conin/out which return FILE_TYPE_CHAR
                Create new keys during installation:
                [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Cdfs]
                [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Cdrom]
                Fix for failure during DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH for LX system
                dlls (pe loader). Didn't fail properly before.
                Check if executable exists in CreateProcessA; fixes VMWare
                installation
                InitCommandLine fix (forgot to copy cmd line)
    - USER32:   Fix for EDIT_WM_Char (couldn't type in numbers anymore)
                EnumDisplaySettingsA accepts negative indices
    - ADVAPI32: Cleanup

 2000-10-03: Michal Necasek <mike@mendelu.cz>
    - KERNEL32: Fix for HMGetFileType. Must return FILE_TYPE_CHAR for standard
                handles (in/out/error)

 2000-10-03: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Watcom makefiles:
                ú Wrote a converter tool to make wlink input from .def files.
                  tools/common - kDef2Wat.exe (Need VA C to compiler currently)
                ú Found a problem with Watcom when trying to link
                  advapi32.dll; It mangles the __stdcall function when
                  they aren't prototyped/delcared extern "C". Haven't found
                  any solution to this, other than prototyping the
                  APIs within extern "C" { }.

 2000-10-02: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - SHLWAPI:  Rewrote VERSION_OsIsUnicode (same as SHELL_OsIsUnicode now)
    - RICHED32: 'Handle' WM_SETTEXT messages. Wine's richedit dll is very
                incomplete. It's better to use the native windows version.
    - KERNEL32: Ported Wine's LoadModule (previously used Open32)
                Changed version apis
                You can now tell Odin to pretend to be Windows 98 or
                Windows NT 4.0 (default = NT40)
                Odin.ini:
                [WinVersion]
                Version=Win98
    - OLE32:    Added stubs for CoGetInstanceFromFile & CoGetInstanceFromIStorage
    - KERNEL32, WSOCK32, WINMM, include\odinwrap.h, SHLWAPI, WNASPI32
                Changes/fixes for new ODINFUNCTION macros

 2000-10-02: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
    - *:        major change in ODINWRAP macros
                and (all) affected sources
    - GDI32:    fixed possible error in text.cpp (strrchr)
    - WNETAP32: started implementation of LAN Manager support :)
                NetApiBuffer*
                NetStatisticsGet
                NetWkstaGetInfo
    - KERNEL32: added HEAP_size export

 2000-10-02: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - KERNEL32: Fixed Pe2Lx (ie. Win32k) TLS problem. Beyond Compare works.
    - Common:   Added very limited dump capability to kFilePE. (Used to
                understand TLS.)
    - Win32k    Added symbols for kernel 14050 (Warp4) and
                14054 (Warp4, WS4eB SMP and UNI).

 2000-10-01: Patrick Haller <phaller@gmx.net>
    - KERNEL32: Optimization of PROFILE calls
    - GDI32:    Fix for uncompressed/RGB bitmaps (biSizeImage == 0)
    - WINMM:    Fix for timer logic - timers still quite untested

 2000-10-01: Sander van Leeuwen <sandervl@xs4all.nl>
    - KERNEL32: Fixed bug introduced by recent command line changes
                (executables with spaces in name/dir)
    - GDI32:    Implemented AddFontResourceW

 2000-10-01: knut st. osmundsen <knut.stange.osmundsen@mynd.no>
    - Win32k:   ú Added IOCtl API for Reading or Writing into another process'
                  address space. (*ProcessReadWrite)
                  This is intended used to implemented ReadProcessMemory and
                  WriteProcessMemory (which is essensial to debuggers I think).
                  I'll implementet them soon, but it sees that it'll
                  require more changes in process.c that I first thought.
                ú Simplified maintaince of kernel imports. (mkcalltab)
                  Removed unused imports.
